\chapter{Abstract}

The field of gravitational waves is still in its early stages, with detections of binary black holes numbering less that \joe{number}.
With th \joe{introdice CWs}
This thesis gives an overview of the current state of research in \gls{GW} astronomy with a focus on methods to search for long duration gravitational waves from neutron stars. In the main content of this thesis we present a new non-parametric search method for continuous gravitational waves entitled SOAP which is orders of magnitude faster than current continuous wave search algorithms with a comparable sensitivity.
We also describe developments of this algorithm which use machine learning to improve the searches robustness to instrumental artefacts within the data and also .
