\section*{Declaration}

The material presented in this thesis is the result of my own work under the supervision of Prof. Graham Woan and Dr Chris Messenger in the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow. It has not been submitted for any other degree at the University of Glasgow, or at any other institution.
This work was conducted as part of the \gls{LVK} collaboration and therefore was made possible with the interaction of many researches within this collaboration.
