\section*{Declaration}

The material presented in this thesis is the result of my own work under the
supervision of Prof. Graham Woan and Dr Chris Messenger in the Institute for
Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow. It has not been submitted
for any other degree at the University of Glasgow, or at any other institution.
This work was conducted as part of the \gls{LVK} collaboration and therefore
was made possible with the interaction of many researchers within this
collaboration.

~\chris{I'm not too familar with the rules on this but I have seen others
provide a bulleted list of the chapters and make statements about each
individually. This is mostly relevant for collaboration papers but could work
here in that it will allow you to state explicitly that chapters 3 and 4 are
published (kind of) papers and that they were written with your supervisors as
collaborators but that it is predominantly your own work. Chapter 5 and 6 are
planned to be papers in the future as well.}
