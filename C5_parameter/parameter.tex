\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce why parameter estimation is useful, why why current search does not
    \item sky position cand narrow targeted searches to search over narrower parameter space
    \item the sky position $\alpha, \delta$ for a \gls{CW} is a function of the frequency evolution of the source
    \item SOAP return a frequency track which give parameters for the sky position
    \item this is currently limited to search for isolated neutrons stars

\end{itemize}

\section{Bayesian Model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Viterbi tracks contain information of the frequency evolution of a potential signal.
    \item A \gls{GW} from an isolated neutron star follows the equations in \ref{}, where we are interested here in the parameters which govern the frequency evolution.
    \item these are the initial frequency $f_0$ and its derivatives $\dot{f}$ and the sky position parameter $\alpha$ and $\delta$.
    \item we can easily define a frequency evolution from this set of parameters by Equation ...... 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prior}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a flat prior in parameter space in $\sin{\delta},\alpha$, where delta ranges between .....etc 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Likelihood}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item we then have a Viterbi track which was identified in the data and a frequncy track which can be easily generated by a model.
    \item To the estimate the parameter for the Viterbi track, we need to define a likelihood function.
    \item item looking at the Viterbi tracks, their noise is highly dependent on the \gls{SNR} of the signal
    \item given that this is not an analytically defined distribution, we cna define it empirically
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Nested sampling}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimates Evidence .....
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}
Tested on a number of signals to see what we could recover, 
plots of sky positions compared to injected signals, 
Gaussian noise etc...
