When searching for \gls{GW} signals, it is important to understand the origins of noise artefacts in the detectors data which does not originate from an astrophysical source.
A large fraction of \gls{GW} search algorithms, including SOAP above, assume that the detectors noise follows a Gaussian distribution.
However, the detectors contain artefacts which do not follow this distribution. 
These artefacts can negatively affect many searches for \glspl{GW} as they can be easily mistaken for a real \gls{GW} signal.
Some of the potential sources of these artefacts have been mentioned in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector:noise}. 
There are many different classes of artefact, some key types include: glitches, these are short duration broad band bursts in power and instrumental lines which are long duration narrow-band signals.
To conduct a reliable search there are two main tasks which are necessary for detector characterisation.
The first is identifying the artefact such that any search knows which frequency bands and time segments are contaminated.
The search can then address that section of data, this could mean removing that section of data or use more sophisticated techniques to deal with the artefact \citep{pankow2018MitigationInstrumental}.
The second task is to find the source of the artefact. 
If the source of the artefact is found, it can potentially be removed or limited for future data runs.

The focus of this chapter is on a particular class of artefact called instrumental lines and how they affect \gls{CW} searches.
Sec.~\ref{detchar:lines} will introduce different sub-classes of instrumental line and how each of them affects a \gls{CW} search.
Sec.~\ref{detchar:monitor} will outline how these artefacts are detected and monitored, and describe current tools used for this task.
Sec.~\ref{detchar:soap} will describe how the \gls{CW} search algorithm introduces in Sec.~\ref{soap} can be used to search for instrumental lines.
Finally Sec.~\ref{detchar:summary} will show the outputs of the search and this is displayed for ease of use.

% Introduce instrumental lines

Instrumental lines have the general structure that they are persistent noise artefacts.
There are many classes of instrumental line spanning a range from narrow, fixed frequency spectral artefacts to broader ($<0.1$ Hz) features which have a time varying frequency known as wandering lines.
For many of these lines, it is difficult to distinguish them from an astrophysical signal.
They affect search methods in two main ways. 
They can cause the search to produce outliers which are then considered as \gls{GW} candidates.
Extra efforts then have to be made to analyse these outliers further.
If the line is close to the \gls{GW} signal in frequency, then it can conceal the power of the \gls{GW}, or if it is overlapping, the search becomes very difficult.
It is therefore crucial to understand the structure and origin of these lines when performing a search for \gls{GW}, specifically \gls{CW} and stochastic searches.

%
% What lines look like and how the appear in the GW channel

Some instrumental lines are clearly visible when looking at a \gls{ASD} or \gls{PSD} of the \gls{LIGO} detectors. Figure \ref{detchar:line:psd} shows the \gls{ASD} for \glspl{LIGO} Hanford and Livingston detectors during their first observing run (O1) \citep{GWOpen}. This clearly shows some peaks which are associated with strong lines, some have been labelled. There are however, many more weaker line which become visible when spectra are averaged over longer times.

    \caption[Strain \gls{ASD} for the \gls{LIGO} detectors.]{There are many features in the \gls{LIGO} detectors averaged \gls{ASD}. This image was taken from \citep{GWOpen} where I have annotated some of the stronger lines. The power line from the mains in the USA is at 60 Hz. Some of the calibration lines are around 30 Hz, 331 Hz and 1083 Hz. The various violin modes of the suspensions are at 300, 500, 600 and 900 Hz where I have only marked the 500 Hz mirror suspension modes \citep{GWOpen}.}
    \label{detchar:line:psd}
\end{figure}
%
The frequency spectrum in Fig.~\ref{detchar:line:psd} shows the time averaged spectra the \gls{GW} channel of the \gls{LIGO} detectors. 
The \gls{GW} channel is essentially the error signal on the mirrors whilst they are being held on a resonance, i.e. how much the mirrors have to be moved to keep the same intensity at the output of the interferometer.
The lines seen in the spectrum are not from any \gls{GW} and are usually from ground based sources.
To see the lines in the \gls{GW} channel, they must be coupled in via some mechanism. 
There are a number of ways in which this happens which are outlined in \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation}.
This includes coupling via shared power and grounds. 
When different components share the same power supplies, if a component draws power with a given period, then the voltage will decrease repeatedly at this frequency. 
Another component which shares this same power supply can then also see this drop in voltage and this can potentially become visible in a recorded output. 
Another mechanism is coupling through magnetic fields, this is common when cables are close to each other, the magnetic field in one can affect the other, therefore, coupling noise between different systems.
Coupling can also occur though a physical connection, known as mechanical coupling, for example the resonances of the suspension fibres which couple directly into the mirrors.

%
% Origins of some lines and how they can be mitigated

Many of the spectral lines seen in the frequency spectrum, Fig.~\ref{detchar:line:psd} are fundamental to the design of the detector. 
These cannot be eliminated, therefore need to be understood such that their effect on searches is minimised.
Some of the strongest of these lines are listed below:
\begin{description}
	\item[Power line] The power line harmonics are fundamental to the detector and originate from the mains supply in the USA. These lines exist at 60 Hz which is the frequency of the mains alternating current oscillates at \citep{aasi2015CharacterizationLIGO}.
	
	\item[Violin modes] The violin modes are associated with the suspensions of the mirrors and the beam splitter in the detector. These are designed to have a narrow frequency spectrum such that they contaminate as smaller part of the spectrum as possible. These are the lines around 500 Hz for the mirrors and 300, 600 and 900 Hz for the beam-splitter \citep{GWOpen} in Fig.~\ref{detchar:line:psd}.
	
	\item[Calibration lines] The mirrors of the \gls{LIGO} detectors, are held at a resonance of the cavity in the arms of the interferometer. This then requires a feedback loop to hold them at resonance as a \gls{GW} passes the detector. Calibration lines are used to calibrate this feedback loop such that the arm length changes are accurate \citep{tuyenbayev2016ImprovingLIGO,coughlin2010NoiseLine}.
\end{description}
In \citep{davis2019ImprovingSensitivity}, techniques are used to counter the affect of power lines and calibration lines on searches. 

Along with the fundamental lines of the detector which cannot be removed at the source, there are a large number of other lines whose source has been found and can be removed. 
Many of these are from mechanisms described earlier such as shared power supplies or grounds. These can be removed by, for example, using a different power supply for different systems. See \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation} for a full investigation into the mitigation of these lines.

%
% How lines affect CW searches

These lines have large effect on all searches for \glspl{GW} both if the astrophysical signals frequencies overlap with the frequency of the line and can cause outliers. 
Long duration searches for \glspl{CW} are particularity sensitive to this type of artefact.
As described in Sec.~\ref{searchcw}, \glspl{CW} are long duration signals with a slowly varying frequency.
In the case of an isolated neutron star, the signal which is searched for is narrow-band and a fixed frequency which is Doppler modulated by the earths rotation and orbit.
For certain areas of parameter space, such as close to the poles, the astrophysical signal of an isolated neutron star can appear very similar to a narrow band fixed frequency instrumental line. 
Many of these lines can be mitigated by using multiple detectors data. If a signal appears in a one detector and not the others, then it is likely that the signal is from an instrumental line and not an astrophysical source. 
These contaminated frequency bands can either be removed or a statistic similar to that described in Sec.~\ref{soap:las} or \citep{keitel2014SearchContinuous} can be used to limit their effect.
However, there are many examples of instrumental line which appear at the same or similar frequencies in multiple detectors.
These pose a real challenge to some \gls{CW} searches, and require a lot of investigation to limit their affect.

%
% into to why lines are monitored

When a detector is running, it is very important to identify instrumental lines and monitor them.
This can then lead to either locating the origin of the line such that it can be removed, or allowing it to be flagged for other search algorithms.
The lines affect searches in the \gls{GW} channel, this is the output of the detector which \gls{GW} are observed and is the data using is previous chapters.
This is the channel where the affect of lines is intended to be minimised.

%
% Auxilliary channels 
As well and the \gls{GW} channel the detector records many different channels known as auxiliary channels. 
These channels monitor many components of the detector, and importantly are not sensitive to \gls{GW}.
Many of the channels useful for line searches are the \glspl{PEM}.
These include sensors such as seismometers measuring the ground motion, temperature sensors, magnetometers etc. 
These channels can be very useful in identifying the source of an instrumental line.
The main goal is to reduce the number of artefacts in the \gls{GW} such that it is as close to Gaussian noise as possible.
If an artefact shows up in the \gls{GW} channel in coincidence with one of the \gls{PEM} then this is an indicator that the artefact originates from something related to that \gls{PEM}.
For example, say a magnetometer located near some electronics has a long duration line in its spectrum at the same frequency as the main \gls{GW} channel. 
This indicates that noise from this piece of electronics is somehow coupling into the detector. 
One can then investigate that piece of electronics further to see how it couples in.

%
% tools to monitor all the channels

There are a number of tools which are used to monitor these spectral lines, along with a team of people which regularly look though the results, a summary of these for the first two observing runs of \gls{LIGO} can be found in \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation}.
Some of the tools used are described below. 

\begin{description}
	\item[Fscan] Fscan \citep{coughlin2010NoiseLine} takes \glspl{FFT} of the raw detector data, typically these are 1800s long. This is done for all of the auxiliary channels as well as the \gls{GW} channel. The \glspl{FFT} are then averaged over a day and time-frequency spectrograms are generated. After known lines such as Violin modes and power lines are subtracted, noise lines can be identified. A threshold can be set and anything in the spectrograms which exceed this threshold are flagged as a line. These can then be compared across multiple different channels. More detail on how the lines are identified can be found in \citep{coughlin2010NoiseLine}
	
	\item[Coherence] Coherence searches for the coherence between different channels and different detectors. This is similar to searches for stochastic gravitational waves. More detail of how this works can be found in \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation}
	
	\item[Finetooth] Many of the instrumental lines found are part of combs. These are repeating structures where the harmonics (teeth) of a line make up the comb which is defined by the start frequency and tooth spacing. Finetooth is a tool which identifies and monitors these combs \citep{neunzertDailyComb}.
	
	\item[NoEMi] NoEMi uses \glspl{FFT} and identifies peaks within the spectrum. It can then find coincidences with auxiliary channels and label is there are overlapping peaks with the \gls{GW} channel. This can then tracks the lines with time. All of the information is stored in a database where more detail on its operation can be found in \citep{accadia2012NoEMiNoise}.
	
\end{description}


These tools offer many ways for the detector characterisation team to identify instrumental lines and hunt for their source. A summary of these efforts for the advanced \gls{LIGO} data can be found in \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation}.
The following sections describe how the SOAP search described in Sec.~\ref{soap} can be used as an extra tool to aid in the identification and monitoring of instrumental lines.

\section{\label{detchar:soap}Identifying and cleaning lines with SOAP}
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Why SOAP may be good at finding instrumental lines
% 
The SOAP search has been run on a number of observing runs to search for \gls{CW}. 
One of the major factors which limited the sensitivity of the search is the presence of instrumental lines within the data. 
Many of the potential candidates which SOAP returned could be identified as an instrumental lines 
An example of once of these candidates can be seen in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:astrowander}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C5_detchar/plot_F111_5_wandering_line.png}
	\caption[Broad wandering line example.]{Broader instrumental lines are generally weaker and can be mistaken for an astrophysical signal by the SOAP astrophysical search. Above an example of two broad line in the H1 detector is shown, where SOAP has identified one of the. The top two panels show the summed spectrograms from the H1 and L1 panels with the optimal Viterbi track overlaid. The third panel shows the normalised spectrogram power along the Viterbi track for each of the detectors. The final panel shows the Viterbi map for this frequency band.}
	\label{detchar:soap:astrowander}
\end{figure}
%
Figure \ref{detchar:soap:astrowander} shows a broad and wandering line in a single detector causing the SOAP search to mistake it for an astrophysical signal. 
This is because the SOAP line aware statistic from Sec.~\ref{soap:las} find areas of higher power which are consistent between detectors according to the parameters of the statistic. 
These types of line are difficult to mitigate in the astrophysical search, however, this has a side effect of being useful to identify the instrumental lines themselves.
In this section, I will explain the setup of the search to identify instrumental lines.

Whilst it is useful to run searches on auxiliary channels when trying to identify the lines source, the aim of this search was to flag potential lines.
Therefore, this search currently only runs on the \gls{GW} channel where they flagged lines can be investigated further.
In the future this could be modified to search multiple channels to find coincidences between them. 
Sec.~\ref{soap} described how multiple detectors can be used to increase the sensitivity of a search for \glspl{CW}. 
However, when searching for instrumental lines, the aim is to have the reverse effect, therefore, a simple search is run separately on each detector. 
This then removed any of the statistics developed in Sec.~\ref{soap:las} and uses the `normalised' \gls{SFT} power as the statistic in the SOAP search.
The single detector search then has one parameter to vary, the transition matrix parameter. 
This governs how probable the frequency track is to transition up straight or down a frequency bin.
In this search we are aiming to find any non Gaussian artefacts, therefore, we allow an equal probability for the track to jump in any direction, however, limit it to change by one frequency bin after each time segment.  
Whilst the astrophysical search summed the \glspl{SFT} over one day as shown in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:astrowander}, for the line search, we assume that instrumental lines are stronger than astrophysical signals and therefore should be identifiable in the raw 1800s long \glspl{SFT}.
The Fscan search described above generates \glspl{SFT} every day of varying lengths, this include 1800 s long \glspl{FFT}. 
For this line search, we split the 1800 s long Fscan \glspl{FFT} into 0.2 Hz wide sub-bands and run the single detector search on each sub-band. 
This then returns the same outputs as described in Sec.~\ref{soap} and Sec.~\ref{machine}: the frequency track (Viterbi track), a Viterbi map and a Viterbi statistic. 
Here the Viterbi statistic is just the sum of the \gls{SFT} power along the frequency track. 
The line search then outputs plots as shown in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:linewander}, \ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot}, \ref{detchar:soap:lineplot} and \ref{detchar:soap:wanderplot}. 
These plots and the equivalent plots for other sub-bands can then allow each sub-band to be classified into containing an instrumental artefact or not.
An example of the SOAP line search being run on the H1 detector on the same instrumental line but with slightly wider frequency band as Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:astrowander} can be seen in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:linewander}
This shows how the line search identifies the same instrumental line albeit at a higher resolution and can flag it for further investigation.

	\caption[Example SOAP output for Gaussian like noise.]{The SOAP search outputs three main quantities, the Viterbi maps, the Viterbi track and the Viterbi statistic. The Viterbi track is shown above overlaid onto the 1800s \gls{SFT} power spectrum including the detector gaps for \glspl{LIGO} Hanford detector (H1) in its second observing run (O2) \citep{}. This track is an indicator as to what type of signal the track is following. The above track indicated that this is just noise. The returned Viterbi statistic is also consistent with that of noise. The Viterbi map is another visualisation of the sub-band, how to interpret this has been explained in previous sections. However, here there does no appear to be a clear signal. The final panel is a way to visualise how the \gls{SFT} power changes along the Viterbi track. Also on this plot is an estimate of the mean noise floor for this band to visualise how the sensitivity of the detector changed over the course of the run. }
	\label{detchar:soap:noiseplot}
\end{figure}
%
Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot} shows an example of the spectrogram of a sub-band which does not contain any signal or spectral artefacts but is Gaussian distributed noise. 
The track in the top panel of this plots shows the power spectrum including detector gaps from 1800 s \glspl{SFT} in \gls{LIGO} Hanfords data from its second observing run (O2). 
The Viterbi track is overlaid and the structure of the track indicates that there is no signal present, this is because the track appears to be randomly wandering and has a large spread over the entire band. 
The Viterbi map plot does not show much structure and contains areas of low log-probability.
Using this information along with the Viterbi statistic result, this particular sub-band can be considered to not contain an instrumental artefact. 
%
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C5_detchar/track_F47_6_47_8_linenarrow.png}
	\caption[Example SOAP output for string narrow instrumental line.]{The equivalent plot as in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot} can be made when there is a narrow spectral artefact in the band. The above is again results from \glspl{LIGO} Hanford detector (H1) in its second observing run (O2) using 1800s \gls{SFT} power spectrum. In this there is a narrow spectral line at $\sim 47.69$ Hz. The Viterbi track then follows this line of high power. The Viterbi map has much higher values for the log-probability in this line case compared to the noise case, this is an indicator some real signal. The probability in the Viterbi maps drops to zero in some areas due to the strength of the instrumental line. }
	\label{detchar:soap:lineplot}
\end{figure}
%

Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:lineplot} demonstrates the same figure as before but now with a strong and narrow instrumental line in the sub-band. 
The Viterbi track now clearly indicates that there is a narrow spectral artefact present in the sub-band. The track does not have much spread over the band and stays at an approximately fixed frequency. 
The Viterbi map plot then shows that there are clear areas around the track which are of high log-probability. 
The areas of white in the Viterbi maps area areas where the probability of a signal falls to zero. 
These pieces of information along with the large value of the Viterbi statistic indicate that there is a narrow spectral artefact within the sub-band.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C5_detchar/track_F53_7_53_9_wander.png}
	\caption[Example SOAP output for wandering line.]{The equivalent plot as in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot} can be made when there is a wandering spectral line. The above is again results from \glspl{LIGO} Hanford detector (H1) in its second observing run (O2) using 1800s \gls{SFT} power spectrum. This shows how some spectral lines do not have a fixed frequency bin can wander through the band. These are especially hard to track and monitor. The Viterbi track here shows is clearly different from the noise case in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot} as the track is more tightly concentrated around some areas of power. }
	\label{detchar:soap:wanderplot}
\end{figure}
%

Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:wanderplot} once again shows the equivalent plots to Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot} and \ref{detchar:soap:lineplot} but now contains some wandering spectral artefact. 
This is some line which wanders in frequency as is moves though the band. 
This can be seen in the frequency track, which here does not have much spread, however, the frequency of the potential signal changes with time. 
There are also areas where the signal could have potentially switched to a separate spectral artefact within the same band. Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:wanderplot} shows this discrete jump around January. 

The combination of the Viterbi statistic, Viterbi map and spectrograms are then used to flag this sub-band as containing some sort of instrumental artefact. 
The example plots here show some specific examples, however, there is a lot of variation in the types of lines and features which appear in all of the SOAP outputs.
This line search then works by initially ranking all of the Viterbi statistics, the largest values will be most likely from an instrumental artefact. 
Figure \ref{detchar:soap:rankedstats} shows an example of a histogram of the ranked statistics from O2.
The sub-bands which give statistic values which lie outside the main distribution can then be viewed for further investigation. The high values outside the distribution are currently defined rather arbitrarily, this could either be something like the top 10\% of sub-bands or could involve looking through the ranked list until signals begin to look like noise. 
The top results which are deemed to come from an instrumental line can be compared to the known line lists from the other line tools mentioned in Sec.~\ref{detchar:monitor}.
Any new lines can be investigated further by methods described in \citep{covas2018IdentificationMitigation} using the tools in Sec.~\ref{detchar:monitor}.
When running this search SOAP identified lines which did not appear in other line lists, therefore, offers a method to search for weaker lines. \joe{actually check this}

\joe{need to mention why this is good as extra tool, i.e. searching for wandering lines, identifies track of very weak lines etc, things that other searches cannot do}

\section{\label{detchar:summary}Summary pages}
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Summary pages are an important tool when searching for instrumental lines. 
There is such a large amount of data both in frequency and time space, and channels to search though when looking for instrumental lines.
Summary pages distill this data such that only the important information is shown.
This enables line to be identified easily when looking through sub-bands. 
The criteria when designing summary pages is that they are easy to navigate and the important information is shown in a clear and concise way.
How we display this information will be explained later in this section.
These summary pages exist for the above searches in \citep{bayleyHome} where this is only accessible by \gls{LIGO} members.

For the SOAP search summary pages were generated for each observing run and for the two \gls{LIGO} detectors. 
This was done for various timescales: for the entire observing run and separately for each month.
This allows the variation of a line to be observed for the entire length and also artefacts on shorter timescales to be observed.
Once the detector, observing run and timescale is set, the band is split into 0.2 Hz wide sub-bands. 
The Viterbi search with a flat transition matrix and using the summed \gls{SFT} power as the statistic.
A flow diagram of how the SOAP search works for instrumental line searches can be found in Fig.~\ref{detchar:summary:flow}.

	\input{./C5_detchar/detchar_flow.tikz}
	
	\caption[Flow diagram for SOAP line search.]{\label{detchar:summary:flow} The SOAP search for instrumental lines is simpler than other searches. A simple version of the search is run separately for each detector, where the raw \glspl{SFT} are divided by their running median, narrow-banded and then the search is run. }
	
\end{figure} 
These stages are as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item[1. \glspl{SFT} from timeseries] The \glspl{SFT} are generated for the \gls{GW} output channel. This is done by the Fscan search, therefore we do not repeat this process. Currently the search only runs on the \gls{GW} channel, however, in the future could be made to run on others.
	
	\item[2. Divide \gls{SFT} by running median] In this stage each \gls{SFT} is divided by its running median which is 100 bins wide. The running median takes each \gls{SFT} and applies a window of 100 bins, where the median of these 100 frequency bins is taken. This window then slides over the \gls{SFT} producing an `filtered' \gls{SFT}which should exclude outliers.
	
	\item[3. Narrow-band \gls{SFT}] The \gls{SFT} is then split into 0.2 Hz wide sub-bands for the SOAP search to run on. These smaller bands are chosen as the SOAP search pull information on the most likely track, therefore, smaller bands are not contaminated by areas of high power in neighbouring frequency bands. 
	
	\item[4. Run SOAP and generate plots] This stage runs the SOAP search with a flat transition matrix probability and generates plots as shown in Fig.~\ref{detchar:soap:noiseplot}.
	
	\item[5. Generate summary page] Finally the summary pages are built which take all of the bands and puts them in a table. This table can be ordered by the value of the Viterbi statistic, or can be searched for particular frequency bands. 
\end{description}

An example of a summary page is shown in Fig.~\ref{detchar:summary:plots}. This has been annotated showing how to navigate the page. 
There are generally two separate parts to the page: selecting the observing run and frequencies, and viewing the outputs.
The observing run is selected at the top of the page, where currently this has only ben run on O2 and O3. 
From this menu the detector can be selected, currently only \glspl{LIGO} H1 and L1 detectors are present.
The selection of frequencies and viewing of outputs then happens on this page.
The key information of each page is the plots shown in Figs.~\ref{detchar:soap:linewander} - \ref{detchar:soap:wanderplot}.
These clearly show the data with a number of representations of the data. They show the time frequency spectrgrams of the data, the output Viterbi tracks which identify the most probable frequency track, the Viterbi maps which allow the probability of a signal as a function of the time and frequency bin to be viewed. 
Finally they show the spectrogram power along the Viterbi track with the mean noise floor of the detector during the observing run.
This should provide enough information to determine whether an instrumental line in present.
To navigate each page, the left panel contains a calendar where the start and end times of a result can be selected. 
Currently there are pre-defined times which can be selected from. This allows a line to be investigated for a shorter or longer time period.
This can be useful when a new instrumental line appears and it needs to be investigated only from when the line appears. 
Below this in the left panel of the page there is a table where each cell is one of the sub-bands which was searched through 
This allows individual frequency bands of interest to be searched for as well as the table to be limited between different frequencies.
The table contains four columns: the frequency of the sub-bands, the Viterbi statistic, the $\sigma$ from the mean of all the sub-band Viterbi statistics and extra information.
The first two columns are self explanatory, the frequency range of the sub-band and the resulting Viterbi statistic from that sub-band. The table can be ordered by the Viterbi statistic such that only the highest values are investigated.
The $\sigma$ from the mean is found by approximating the distribution of the Viterbi statistics as a Gaussian. 
A Gaussian is then fit to the distribution using a simple least squares, each statistic then has a multiple of $\sigma$ away from the mean of this distribution. 
This is an approximate calculation to give a scale of how significant the statistic in that sub-band is.
The final column contains any extra information which exists for that particular frequency range.
For example, this is filled with other line list information which has been collected from other search methods.
The loud features such as Violin modes can then be marked. This means that these particular bands are likely to have been investigated already allowing this search to focus on any extra instrumental lines.

	\label{detchar:summary:plots}

The summary pages are then hoped to be useful alongside the other tools for searching for instrumental lines. \joe{more}
