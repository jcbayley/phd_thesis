Gravitational waves were first predicted in 1915 as a consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity \citep{einstein2005GrundlageAllgemeinen}.
They are theorised as ripples in the fabric of space-time.
The first observational evidence that \ac{GW} exist came from observations of the Hulse-Taylor binary \citep{weisberg1981GravitationalWaves,weisberg2004RelativisticBinary}. 
This observation showed a binary pulsar system whose separation was decreasing with time. 
If the separation of two orbiting objects is decreasing then the system is losing energy somewhere.
The loss in energy matched the \ac{GR} prediction which assumed the energy was lost to \ac{GW}.
This gave hope of \ac{GW} existence and helped lead the way to designing instruments which could directly detect them.
The first direct detection of gravitational waves was made in 2015 when the two \ac{LIGO} detectors in the US \citep{abbott2016ObservationGravitational} identified a signal from a \ac{BBH} system.
This was not only the first observation of \ac{GW} but gave information on a yet unobserved astrophysical system.
This has since been followed my many more detection's of \ac{BBH} signals involving \ac{LIGO} and Virgo including \citep{abbott2017GW170814ThreeDetector,theligoscientificcollaboration2020GW190425Observation}.
In 2017 the \ac{LIGO} detectors observed the first \ac{BNS} system \citep{abbott2017GW170817Observation} which had a corresponding electromagnetic counterpart.
This allowed verification of the source from optical counterparts and extended the era of multi-messenger astronomy.
These detections opened up the field of gravitational wave astronomy, where many more detections are expected to give more information on the universe and objects within it.

As well as searching for \ac{BBH} and \ac{BNS} signals, there are many efforts to detector other types of \ac{GW} signals. 
This thesis focuses on efforts to search for a particular type of \ac{GW} which are thought to originate from rapidly rotating neutron stars.
In this chapters \ref{intro} and \ref{searchcw} I will review introductory material. 
This includes a general introduction to the generation of gravitational waves in Sec.~\ref{intro:gravwaves} and their sources in Sec.~\ref{intro:sources}.
I will then introduce instruments used to detect \ac{GW} in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector}.
In Chapter \ref{searchcw} I will introduce the general model for \acp{CW} and current methods used to detect them.
Chapters \ref{soap}, \ref{cnn} and \ref{detchar} will go into detail about techniques developed by the author to search for \ac{CW} signals. 
Finally I will summarise this work and discuss future developments in chapter \ref{summary}.

\section{\label{intro:gravwaves}Gravitational waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

In general relativity, gravity is thought of as the curvature of space-time and matter moves according to this curvature. 
The matter in the universe also has an effect on the curvature of the space-time.
The larger the mass of matter the more the space-time is distorted.
Space-time can generally be described by Einstein's field equations,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwaves:efe}
    G_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu \nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor.
The stress energy tensor essentially describes the matter and energy in the universe. Its components contain information on the density of energy and momentum.
The Einstein tensor contains information on the curvature of the universe. 
This can be derived directly from the metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$ which describes the geometry of the universe.
Einstein's equations then explain how the curvature of space-time changes with the energy and matter within it. 
In empty space one can assume that the geometry of space-time is flat, i.e. there is no curvature to space-time. The metric tensor for this can then be defined as,
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{matrix}
\right).
\end{equation}
Each index of this matrix refers to a space-time dimension, i.e. $x^0 = t$, $x^1=x$, $x^2=y$ and $x^3=z$. 
Measuring a distance $dx$ in space-time can be different for different observers, therefore, one needs a measure which is invariant for every observer. 
This is the space-time interval $ds$, also known as the line element, between two `events' in space-time. 
This is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:lineelement}
    ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}.
\end{equation}
As in Einstein's notation this is a sum over the indices $\mu$ and $\nu$.  
Eq.~\ref{intro:lineelement} is essentially Pythagoras's theorem, therefore, can be though to describe the space-time `distance' between the two events.
For flat space-time, $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, this can then be written as,
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.
\end{equation}
The Einstein equations Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwaves:efe} then demonstrate how the curvature of space-time $G_{\mu\nu}$ depends on the matter and energy distribution $T_{\mu \nu}$ within it.

A gravitational wave can be described as a ripple in this space time.
The simplest way to visualise this is just a small time dependent change to the flat space-time metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$.
In linearised theory of gravity, the space-time metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ can be defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwave:metric}
    g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu},
\end{equation}
where $ \eta_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric for flat space-time and $h_{\mu \nu}$ is some perturbation, where $|h_{\mu \nu}| \ll 1$ \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}. 
In this linearised theory the perturbations to the metric tensor are assumed to be small, therefore, Einstein's field equations can be solved such that the solution is a plane wave. 
I will skip over lots of the calculation here, however, more information on this derivation can be found in \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational,} \joe{more references}
By using $g_{\mu \nu}$ from Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwave:metric}, we can write the linearised Einstein equations as,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:lineinstein}
    \Box h_{\mu \nu} = -16 \pi T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\Box$ is the d'Alembert operator which in flat space is defined by,
\begin{equation}
		\Box = -\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
\end{equation}
In empty space there is no matter, therefore, all the components of the stress energy tensor  are zero, i.e. $T_{\mu \nu} = 0$.
This allows Eq.~\ref{intro:lineinstein} to be reduced to, 
\begin{equation}
    \Box h_{\mu \nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
This then takes the form or a common physics problem known as a wave equation. 
This follows the same form as in electrodynamics, therefore, the general solutions can be written down as,
\begin{equation}
    h_{\mu\nu} = A_{\mu\nu}e^{ik_{\alpha} x^{\alpha}},
\end{equation}
where each component of $h_{\mu \nu}$ is a sinusoid travelling along vector $k_{\alpha}$ with amplitude $A_{\mu\nu}$ \citep{capano2011SearchingGravitational}.
At this point the set of equations are not simple, the symmetric tensor $A_{\mu \nu}$ has 10 independent components.
This can be greatly simplified by choosing a different gauge (coordinate system) where the metric perturbation is both transverse and traceless (TT) \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}.
This is just a choice of coordinate system which does not change any current assumptions. A traceless metric is one where the sum of the diagonal elements are 0 and a transverse metric is when the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
This gauge imposes two conditions: one is that $h_{\mu \nu}$ is traceless, i.e. that the sum of the diagonal elements are 0 and the other is that $h_{\mu \nu}$ is transverse. 
The transverse element means that the oscillations of the wave happen perpendicular to the direction of travel.
At this point we can choose that the wave is travelling in the $z$ direction which means that $k = (\omega,0,0,k)$.
By then adopting the TT gauge there are only two unique components to the metric such that the perturbation is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gw:gravwave}
h_{\mu \nu} = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{matrix}
\right) 
e^{i(kt - wt)}.
\end{equation}
The two unique components are then the two polarisations of gravitational waves, $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$.
The affect of each of the polarisations on a ring of test particles can be seen in Fig.~\ref{gw:polarisations} where the gravitational wave is travelling out of the page.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/polarisation_ring.pdf}
    \caption{Shows how the plus and cross polarisation's affect a ring of test particles. This assumes the wave is travelling out of the page and the effects have been greatly exaggerated. This also shows an example of how this effects the test masses of an interferometer. This will be described in more detail in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector}.}
    \label{gw:polarisations}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Generating gravitational waves}

To generate gravitational waves we go back to Eq.~\ref{intro:lineinstein} where we include the stress-energy term on the right hand side.
Following the derivation in \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}, one can find that the gravitational wave amplitude is related to the second moment of the mass distribution.
The second moment of the mass distribution $I_{\mu\nu}$is defined as,
\begin{equation}
    I_{\mu \nu}(t) = \int \rho(t,{\bf x}) x^\mu x^\nu d^3x,
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the mass density, and $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the coordinates \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}. 
This is the quadrupole moment tensor without the trace subtracted.
The gravitational wave amplitude is then defined as,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwave:amp}
    h_{\mu \nu} = \frac{2}{r}  \frac{d^2 I_{\mu \nu}(t-r)}{dt^2}.
\end{equation}
This has a slight modification in the TT gauge, see \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}, however, has the same relationship between the mass quarupole and the \ac{GW} amplitude.
This shows that for a \ac{GW} to be generated, the second derivative of the mass quadrupole moment is needed.
A mass quadrupole moment only exists when the mass distribution is not spherically symmetric.
Therefore, a mass which is asymmetric and accelerating will produce a \ac{GW}.

Systems which will produce detectable \acp{GW} are generally rapidly rotating high mass systems which have some asymmetry around their rotation axis.
The sources of these \ac{GW} will be described in the following section.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\label{intro:sources}Sources and signals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are many potential sources for \ac{GW}. The expected sources can be split into 3 general categories based on their signal type: Transient, Stochastic and \acp{CW}.
These categories are chosen based on the length of the signal and how well modelled the signal is.
Fig.~\ref{intro:sources:signaltypes} shows an example of each of the signals and their category.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/sources_types.pdf}
    \caption{Each \ac{GW} signal type can be categorised based on its signal length and how well the signal is modelled. Transient signals which are short duration, include both well modelled \ac{CBC} signals and unknown Burst signals. Long duration signals include well modelled \ac{CW} signals and unknown Stochastic signals.}
    \label{intro:sources:signaltypes}
\end{figure}
In the sections that follow, I will give an overview of the potential sources of each of these signal categories and their wave-forms.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sources:transient} Transient}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Transient sources of gravitational waves give short duration signals which are observable from milliseconds to tens of seconds depending on the source. 
Some of these sources will emit signals for a much longer time, however these are at a lower frequency and lower amplitude and not observable by current ground based detectors detectors.
Transient signals can be further split into two categories based on how well they are modelled. 
\acp{CBC} have well modelled wave-forms and bursts are generally from un-modelled or unknown sources.

\subsubsection{\label{sources:transient:cbc} Compact Binary Coalescence}

\acp{CBC} originate from the slow in-spiral and merge of two compact objects which are gravitationally bound.
The objects in-spiral as they lost energy to the radiation of gravitational waves.
Dependent on the masses of the two objects, the gravitational waves generated by the system can be detected by ground based detector such as LIGO \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO} and Virgo \citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo}. 
In fact, the only detections to date have been originated from this source which include \citep{abbott2016ObservationGravitational, abbott2017GW170814ThreeDetector, abbott2017GW170817Observation}.

The compact objects referred to here are either either black holes of neutron stars.
There are generally 3 types of \ac{CBC} source: \ac{BBH}, \ac{BNS} and \ac{NSBH}.
The general structure of the wave-form is the same for each of these and follows a `chirp' where the \ac{GW} frequency increases with time until merger. An example of this is shown in Fig.~\ref{intro:sources:signaltypes}.
For higher mass systems such as \ac{BBH} these signals are detectable by ground based detectors for $< 1$s. 
For lower mass systems such as \ac{BNS} they can be detected for longer periods $\mathcal{O}(10)$s. 

The wave-form of a \ac{CBC} signal is generally split into three separate components: the in-spiral, the merger and ring-down \citep{}. 
\joe{rewrite this paragraph}
The inspiral is when the two compact objects are orbiting each other. As they lose energy to gravitational waves, the radius of the orbit decreases and therefore the frequency increases.
The merger is the period when the two objects begin to join to become a single object.
The ring-down is the \ac{GW} emitted of the merged object. The joint object can oscillate whilst it settles into its final state. 

In systems which have a neutron star, during the in-spiral when the objects are close, the neutron star can deform due tidal interactions between the objects \citep{hernandezvivanco2019MeasuringNeutron,harry2018ObservingMeasuring}. 
This becomes useful as it will affect the generated waveform and can help place limits on and determine the \ac{EOS} for the dense matter in a neutron star \citep{hernandezvivanco2019MeasuringNeutron,harry2018ObservingMeasuring}.
\ac{BNS} systems also offer a way do observe objects in multiple different channels, or what is known as multi-messenger astronomy. 
This is where the object can be viewed in the \ac{EM} spectrum as well as in gravitational waves.
This offers much in the field of astronomy as it can aid in the measurement of the Hubble constant \citep{theligoscientificcollaborationandthevirgocollaboration2017GravitationalwaveStandard}. 
Observations of \ac{BBH} systems can also give information on how black holes and \acp{BBH} form, more details on this can be found in \citep{zevin2017ConstrainingFormation,mandel2018MergingStellarmass}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sources:transient:burst}Burst}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Burst sources are also short duration however, are un-modelled or difficult to model.
This means that the exact wave-form of the signal is unknown.
There are a few possible reasons for the lack in knowledge of the waveform: the physics of the system is too complicated to model in a reasonable amount of time or there is no model of the source.
As there is no model to generate wave-forms, burst searches cannot use matched filtering as in \ac{CBC} searches.
Rather burst searches look for short bursts in power which is coherent between multiple detectors \citep{cornish2015BayeswaveBayesian, klimenko2008CoherentMethod}.
There are a number of systems which could potentially emit a short duration burst signals.
These include core collapse supernovae \citep{ott2008GravitationalWave}, \acp{GRB} \citep{aasi2014SearchGravitational}, cosmic strings \citep{damour2005GravitationalRadiation} and other unknown sources.
Detecting \ac{GW} from one of these sources could offer more insight into the processes inside hostile environments.

As burst searches are un-modelled, they are sensitive to almost any signal which is coherent between detectors. 
This allows them to also search for signals from \ac{CBC} as well as any \ac{GW} signal from an unknown source.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Stochastic}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The stochastic background has no signal model, however, is expected to be a persistent source of \ac{GW} in the background of the detector. 
The stochastic background is the incoherent sum of many unresolved \ac{GW} signals.
The source of these signals can be anything from cosmological sources such as cosmic strings to \ac{CBC} signals.
These signals can be thought of as the \ac{GW} analogue of the \ac{CMB}.
The signal is assumed to be isotropic such that it can be observed at any point on the sky \citep{christensen2018StochasticGravitational}. 
As the stochastic background is essentially just noise, it is not possible to detect with a single detector \citep{christensen2018StochasticGravitational}.
Rather, searches for the stochastic background correlate signals between multiple detectors \citep{romano2019SearchesStochastic,christensen2018StochasticGravitational}. 
When detected, these signals may be able to offer insights into the early universe and its formation.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{intro:sources:cw}Continuous waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\acp{CW} are long duration signals which which can be well modelled.
The signals last for times greater than the observation runs of ground based detectors and in general have a fixed or slowly varying frequency.
There are a number or potential sources of \acp{CW} including \acp{CBC} long before their merger.
Long before a \ac{CBC} merger, the two compact objects are orbiting each other whilst slowly in-spiralling.
This will emit a long duration, almost fixed frequency sinusoid as its signal.
This signal however, is at lower frequency than ground based detectors can detect, therefore space based detectors such as \ac{LISA} \citep{danzman} are expected to observe this type of \ac{CW}.

The primary source for many \acp{CW} searches is rapidly rotating neutron stars.
Neutron stars originate when a massive star collapses and are the remnant of this collapse, they are objects with incredibly high density and are highly magnetised.
They have masses around $1.4-2 \; M_{\odot}$ contained in a star with radius of $\sim 10$ km with magnetic fields ranging from $10^8 - 10^{15}$ G \citep{konar2017MagneticFields}.
Despite many observations in the electromagnetic spectrum and a large amount of research, these objects are not well understood.
A key part or neutron stars which is not understood is the \ac{EOS}. A review of the current understanding can be found in \cite{lattimer2016EquationState}.
The \ac{EOS} relates quantities such as the pressure, temperature and volume of a neutron star and dictates how the neutron star matter behaves.
Observations of \acp{GW} from neutron stars can place limits on the \ac{EOS} of this type of matter. 
These observations have already been made in the form of \ac{BNS} mergers \citep{abbott2017GW170817Observation}.
However, independent observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars can add to this understanding.

For a neutron star to emit a gravitational wave it needs to have some asymmetry in its mass distribution around its rotation axis, this follows from Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwave:amp}. 
There are a number of different mechanisms which could cause this and emit \acp{GW}, some of these are reviewed in \citep{glampedakis2017GravitationalWaves,riles2017RecentSearches,haskell2015DetectingGravitational,lasky2015GravitationalWaves}.
Here I will summarise two main theories: Neutron star mountains and neutron star oscillations.


%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Mountains}
%%%%%%%%%

One of more likely mechanisms for detectable \ac{GW} emission from neutron stars is from `mountains' on the surface of the star.
These are permanent deformations on the surface which are non axisymmetric, i.e. the deformation is not symmetric around the rotation axis.
Fig.~\ref{intro:source:cw:mountain} shows an exaggerated example of a deformation.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{testimg.png}
	\caption{star mountain \joe{make figure}}
	\label{intro:source:cw:mountain}
\end{figure}

This deformation or asymmetry can be quantified by the ellipticity $\epsilon$ of the neutron star.
This is defined using the principal moments of inertial,
\begin{equation}
\label{ellipticity}
\epsilon = \frac{I_{xx}-I_{yy}}{I_{zz}},
\end{equation}
where $I_{zz},I_{xx},I_{yy}$ are the principal moment of inertia.
This is when the star is rotating around the $z$ axis so $I_{zz}$ is along the rotation axis. 

There are a number of theories which describe the origin of this axisymmetry.
If the pulsar is in a binary system and accreting material from its companion star, the material can be funnelled towards the magnetic poles by the magnetic field, thereby causing a hot spot \citep{haskell2015DetectingGravitational}.
This `hot spot' could cause a deformation on the surface of the star which is not axi-symmetric. 
The magnetic stresses from strong magnetic fields within the star, could potentially also cause non axi-symmetric deformations to the star.
Finally the spin down of the pulsar itself could cause stresses in the crust of the star until the point of breaking, its then after this break which could leave a distortion in the crust \citep{becker2009NeutronStars}.
More details on the signal waveform of this type of \ac{GW} and methods to search for it will be explained in Sec.~\ref{searchcw}.
 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \subsubsection{Neutron star oscillations}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are a number of oscillation modes within a star such as f-modes, p-modes and r-modes \citep{becker2009NeutronStars}. 
Each of these waves are oscillation in the star similar to oscillations in the earth which are used for seismology.
The difference between the different modes are the restoring force bringing the perturbed state back to equilibrium.
For example, f-modes use gravity as the restoring force where the oscillations happen in the crust of the star.
The more promising of these for gravitational wave emission and detection is the r-mode \citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves}. 
These are oscillations in the superfluid neutron part of the star, where the restoring force is the Coriolis effect from the rotation of the star.
Fig.~\ref{intro:source:cw:rmode} shows an highly exaggerated view of a neutron star with an oscillation mode travelling in each direction.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{testimg.png}
	\caption{Neutron star rotation CFS \joe{make figure}}
	\label{intro:source:cw:rmode}
\end{figure}
If these modes are excited, then they will emit gravitational radiation which the carries angular momentum \citep{}. 
For the mode travelling in a clockwise direction, this angular momentum is positive and the mode travelling anti-clockwise the angular momentum is negative. 
This damps the modes and the magnitude of the perturbation decreases making them extremely difficult to detect.
Now if the neutron star is rotating, this can lead to an effect called the \ac{CFS} instability \citep{chanrasakar,Freidmann}. 
As the rotation speed of the neutron star increases, there are two different effects on the modes travelling in opposite directions. 
For the mode travelling clockwise with the stars rotation, the mode will appear to be travelling faster, therefore, will emit more \ac{GW} taking away angular momentum. This means that this mode will be damped more rapidly.
The interesting affect is for the mode travelling anti-clockwise, opposite to the stars rotation. 
At a certain rotation rate, the mode will be `frozen' from the observers perspective and not \ac{GW} will be emitted.
As the rotation rate increases further, the mode will appear to travel clockwise. 
Here it is key to remember that this mode had negative angular momentum.
As the mode rotates its emits positive angular momentum, which is then subtracted from the modes negative angular momentum.
This effect causes the amplitude of the oscillation to grow and therefore become unstable.
Therefore, a neutron star is unstable to \ac{GW} emission if it is rotating sufficiently fast \citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves}.
For a more detailed view on how r-modes generate \ac{GW} see \citep{owen1998GravitationalWaves}

\section{\label{intro:detector}Detectors}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The theory mentioned above and the indirect detection of gravitational waves from the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar system left little doubt as to whether \ac{GW} existed. 
The real challenge was to design an instrument which could directly detect gravitational waves.
There were a number of different proposed methods for the design of the instrument which includes: resonant bar detectors, both ground based and space based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays and cosmic microwave background detectors. 
Resonant bar detectors were initially designed and built by Joseph Weber \citep{weber1966ObservationThermal}. 
These are large cylinders of metal which should resonate as a gravitational wave passes by. 
There are a few different designs of this type of detector, including an omni-directional design \citep{dewaard2003MiniGRAILFirst}. 
The majority of these detectors are no longer operational.
Pulsar timing arrays aim to use the accurate arrival time of pulses from millisecond pulsars to measure \ac{GW} \citep{hobbs2017GravitationalWave}. As a \ac{GW} passes between the pulsar and the observer, the arrival time of the pulses should change. 
Whilst a detection has not been made using pulsar timing arrays, these methods are still in use.
Cosmic microwave background detectors aimed to look for evidence of gravitational waves in the polarisation's of the CMB \citep{ade2018ConstraintsPrimordial}.  
These use the a range of detectors to look at the CMB however, are yet to confirm a detection of a \ac{GW} signal.
The most commonly known design of a \ac{GW} detector is the ground based interferometer, these made the first detection of \ac{GW} in 2015 \citep{abbott2016ObservationGravitational}. 
These are the focus of this section as the analysis that will follow uses data from the \ac{LIGO} detectors in the USA \citep{abbott2009LIGOLaser,aasi2015AdvancedLIGO} and Virgo detector in Italy \citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo,acernese2008StatusVirgo}. 

%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Laser Interferometers}
%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

Laser interferometers use the interference of light to measure a length with high precision.
The majority of this section will focus on ground based interferometers such as \ac{LIGO} and Virgo \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO,acernese2015AdvancedVirgo}.
A simple design of an interferometer is shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:interferometer}. 
Here it shows how the laser is equally split into two, each of these beams is sent down perpendicular arms of the detector. 
The light then returns to the beam splitter where the two beams are combined and sent to a photo-detector.
At the output, there is an interference pattern between the two beams.
If the length of one of the arms is changed then the interference pattern will change as the phase of one beam changes with respect to the other.
Each of the arms is a Fabry-Perot cavity \citep{}, this increases the amount of time light spends within an arm and therefore increases the detectors effective arm length. This helps to increase the sensitivity of the detector \joe{remove this sentence or go into more detail on extra features}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/interferometer.pdf}
    \caption{This figure shows a basic interferometer.ETMY and ETMX refer to the external test masses, which are just mirrors at the end of the interferometer arms. ITMY and ITMX refer to the internal test masses, these create a cavity in the interferometers arms which can build up laser power. BS is the beam splitter which splits the Laser beam equally to each arm, this them recombines the beams back to the detector.}
    \label{detectors:interferometer}
\end{figure}

This can be used in gravitational wave detection as the mirrors at the end of each arm of the interferometer can be treated as `free' test masses.
Fig.~\ref{detectors:interferometer} shows the effect of a \ac{GW} in free test masses.
In the interferometer, this affect essentially changes the relative lengths of the two arms.
The change in the interference pattern with time is then related to the \ac{GW}.
Actual ground based \ac{GW} detectors such as \ac{LIGO} \citep{abbott2009LIGOLaser} and Virgo \citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo} are much more complicated than described above.
They use many techniques to reduce affects on the detector which are not astrophysical.
Some of these effects are listed in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector:noise}


%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Detector response}
%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

An important factor to know when using detector data to search for astrophysical signals is the detectors response.
This measures how sensitive the detector is to different locations on the sky.
An example of the antenna response for \ac{LIGO} is in Fig.~\ref{intro:detectors:response} where the detectors arms lie on the x and y axis of the image.
This is clear when thinking about how a gravitational wave affects the test masses. 
As the \ac{GW} is transverse to its propagation, when the detector is face on to the source, there will be a maximum change in the arm lengths and therefore a maximum sensitivity. 
In the same way the sensitivity will be at a minimum when edge to the source.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/LIGO_beam_patterns.png}
    \caption{The antenna response is shown as in \citep{romano2019SearchesStochastic} for the plus, cross and average polarisation's. The detectors arms lie on the x and y axis in the above plots. }

To increase the sensitivity of the \ac{LIGO} detectors, any effect on the output of the interferometer which is not astrophysical needs to be reduced.
This involves understanding what causes certain noise features in the detector, and how the affect of these can be reduced. 
Within the detector, there are many sources of noise.
Some of these noise sources and their affect on the detectors strain sensitivity are all shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity} from \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO}.

\end{figure}
Here I will summarise some of the limiting sources and also sources which become useful for understanding later sections.

\begin{description}
\item[Seismic noise] This originates from the seismic activity of the earth and effects the lower frequencies. This can be earthquakes or ocean waves. Seismic waves cause the mirrors to oscillate and induce a change in the length of the arm. This is reduced by having multi stage suspensions in the detectors.

\item[Coating noise] This is in general due to two main factors, the thermal noise of the coating and brownian noise. The Brownian noise is from the mechanical dissipation in the coating and the thermal noise is due to thermal dissipation. The Brownian noise is the dominant factor as shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity}. This is reduced by using different coatings on the mirrors.

\item[Quantum noise] Quantum noise is a fundamental limit due to the statistical uncertainty of counting photons. This limits the sensitivity at many frequencies.There are methods to reduce this include squeezing of the light \citep{}. 

\item[Electronics noise] Whilst this is not shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity}, this becomes important to searches described later. These have a different effect on the detector which is more narrowband frequency lines. This is generated by the digital and analogue electronics that are used to measure the signal. 
\end{description}

There are also many other sources of noise in the detector which I have not listed. However, these are often not the limiting cases of noise or are not relevant to this thesis.
In Sec.~\ref{detchar} I will go into more detail about specific noise sources in the detector known as instrumental lines and how they can be monitored and potentially removed.

\section{\label{intro:prob} Bayes Theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A key part in understanding the different methods to search for \ac{GW} or any data analysis, is understanding probability and statistics. 
This gives understanding of the random processes underlying all measured quantities. 
Whilst there are generally two approaches to statistics: Frequentist and Bayesian, here I will focus on the Bayesian approach.

\subsection{\label{intro:prob:basic}Basic probability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Initially I will define some basic concepts of probability.
We can define the probability of some event $A$ as $p(A)$ where probabilities follow $0 \leq p(A) \leq 1$ and some other event $B$ which has a probability $p(B)$ and follows $0 \leq p(B) \leq 1$.

\begin{description}
\item [Union]
A union is the probability of either and event $A$ happening or event $B$ happening. This is written as, $p(A \cup B)$.

\item [Intersection]
An intersection is then the probability that both and event $A$ and an event $B$ happens. This is written as $p(A \cap B)$.

\item [Independent and dependent Events]
If the events $A$ and $B$ are independent, i.e. the event $A$ does not affect the outcome of event $B$, then,
\begin{equation}
p(A \cap B) = p(A)p(B).
\end{equation}
However, if the event $A$ is dependent on event $B$, i.e. the event $A$ affects event $B$ or vice versa, then the joint probability of both events is,
\begin{equation}
\label{dependentevent}
p(A \cap B) = p(A)p(B \mid A) = p(B)p(A \mid B).
\end{equation}
Here $p(B \mid A)$ means the probability of event $B$ happening given that event $A$ has happened.

\item [Conditional probability]
Conditional probability arises from situations where the outcome of one event will affect the outcome of future events.
The definition of this arises from the the dependent events defined above in Eq.~\ref{dependentevent},
\begin{equation}
p(A \mid B) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(B)}.
\end{equation}

\item [Bayes Theorem]
Bayes theorem can then be defined using conditional probabilities. i.e we can use
\begin{equation}
p(A \mid B) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(B)} \quad \rm{and} \quad p(B \mid A) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(A)}
\end{equation}
such that then,
\begin{equation}
p(B)p(A \mid B) = p(A)p(B \mid A)
\end{equation}
and this is rearranged to Bayes theorem,
\begin{equation}
p(A \mid B) = \frac{p(A)p(B \mid A)}{p(B)}
\end{equation}

\end{description}

\subsection{\label{intro:prob:bayes}Bayesian Inference}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We can take Bayes theorem from Sec.~\ref{intro:prob:basic} and apply it to a problem which involves infering some parameters from some model. Here we can relabel the events $A$ and $B$ with the data ${\bm d}$ and the parameters ${\bm \theta}$ of some model $I$.
Eq.~\ref{intro:prob:bayes} then becomes,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:bayes:bayes}
p({\bm \theta} \mid {\bm d}, I) = \frac{p({\bm \theta}, I)p({\bm d} \mid {\bm \theta}, I)}{p({\bm d} \mid I)}
\end{equation}
where each of the components are assigned names: $p({\bm \theta} \mid {\bm d})$ is the posterior distribution, $p({\bm \theta})$ is the prior distribution,  $p({\bm d} \mid {\bm \theta})$ is the likelihood and $p({\bm d})$ is the evidence.

\begin{description}
\item [Posterior]
The posterior distribution describes the probability of a parameter ${\bf \theta}$ in some model $I$ given some data $d$. For many problems this is the distribution which is most useful as it informs you the most likely set of parameters of you model given some observation.
\item [Prior]
The Prior distribution is a key part of Bayesian statistics. This distribution describes any information which you have prior to the observation. This is a distribution defined by the user, where you define a distribution of the parameters based on what you expect to be true.
\item [Likelihood]
The likelihood is where the observation is included in the calculation. This tells you how probable it is to get the observed data $d$ given the model $I$ with the set of parameters $\theta$. 
\item [Evidence]
The evidence is the probability of the data itself given the choice of model. This is found by integrating the likelihood over all possible values of ${\bm \theta}$ weighting them by our prior belief of that value of ${\bm \theta}$. This known as a marginal distribution and is defined by,
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:bayes:evidence}
    p({\bm d} \mid I) = \int p({\bm \theta}, I)p({\bm d} \mid {\bm \theta}, I) d{\bm \theta}.
\end{equation}
\end{description}


Bayes theorem then gives a description of the probability distribution of some parameters in a model given some observation.
Often when using Bayesian statistics the aim is to find posterior distribution of parameters.
There are very few cases where this can be calculated analytically, therefore, numerical methods are almost always used to find the posterior.
This can be difficult to calculate numerically especially in problems where the parameters space has many dimensions.
The most difficult part to calculate is the evidence in Eq.~\ref{intro:bayes:evidence}, this involves calculating an integral over all possible parameters.
There is however, a way around having to calculate this. For any given mode $I$, the evidence $p({\bm d}\mid I)$ is the same for any set of parameters ${\bm \theta}$ in Eq.~\ref{intro:bayes:bayes}. 
The evidence is then just a normalisation factor for the posterior distribution. 
When different models are not being compared, and we assume the model $I$ to be true, we no longer need to calculate the evidence.
The posterior distribution can then be found by sampling,
\begin{equation}
    p({\bm \theta} \mid {\bm d}, I) \propto p({\bm \theta}, I)p({\bm d} \mid {\bm \theta}, I).
\end{equation}
To find this posterior you could then calculate (sample) the value for every point in parameter space. This however, is very computationally expensive and often the posterior distribution is located in a small area in parameter space. 
Therefore, the majority of the time is sampling a area of parameter space where the posterior is close to zero, and this is not particularly useful. 
A method titled \ac{MCMC} was proposed \citep{metropolis1953EquationState} to deal with this issue, more information on this can be found in \citep{vanravenzwaaij2018SimpleIntroduction,sharma2017MarkovChain}.
This builds up the posterior distribution by randomly jumping around in the parameter space.
It starts by calculating the posterior value for a particular point in parameter space. Then it will randomly jump to another parameter space point. 
The posterior can then be calculated again, if the posterior value is higher then the jump is `accepted'. This just means that the parameter values of this point are stored.
If the posterior value is lower than the previous step then the jump is accepted with some probability. This means that there is a random chance that a value lower than the current is accepted.
As the accepted positions aim for areas where the posterior is higher, \ac{MCMC} does not waste time calculating areas in parameter space of low posterior values.
The samples which were accepted then build the posterior distribution. 

In certain situations it can be useful to calculate the evidence in Eq.\ref{intro:bayes:evidence}. 
For example, if there are two different models which could represent the data, the evidence can be used to determine which of the two models is more likely.
This is known as a Bayes factor where two models $I_1$ and $I_2$ are compares and is defined as,
\begin{equation}
    B = \frac{p({\bm d} \mid I_1)}{p({\bm d} \mid I_2)}
\end{equation}
This then requires the calculation of the evidence.
To estimate the evidence efficiently a method known as Nested sampling can be used, this is explained in detail in \citep{skilling2006NestedSampling,speagle2019DynestyDynamic}.
By calculating the Bayes factor, which is similar to a likelihood ratio, one can find the posterior odds of a particular model by using,
\begin{equation}
		\frac{p(I_1 \mid \mathbf{d})}{p(I_2 \mid \mathbf{d})} = \frac{p(I_1)}{p(I_2)} \frac{p(\mathbf{d} \mid I_1)}{p(\mathbf{d} \mid I_2)}.
\end{equation}
The can be written as \textit{posterior odds = prior odds $\times$ bayes factor}. This is then a comparison of how likely different models are given some observation. 

The methods described above then provide a way to estimate parameters of a model given some data. 
Also this provides a way to compare different models given some observation.
In following sections the methods described above are used to estimate various parameters.
