\Glspl{GW} were first predicted in 1915 as a consequence of Einstein's general
theory of relativity \citep{einstein2005GrundlageAllgemeinen}.  They are
theorised as ripples in the fabric of space-time.  The first observational
evidence that \glspl{GW} exist came from observations of the Hulse-Taylor
binary \citep{weisberg1981GravitationalWaves,weisberg2004RelativisticBinary}.
This observation of a pulsar in a binary system showed that the periastron was
reached slightly early after each orbit, implying that the pulsars orbit was
decreasing with time.  If the separation of two orbiting objects is decreasing
then the system must be losing energy.  The loss in energy matched the \gls{GR}
prediction which assumed the energy was lost to \glspl{GW}.  This gave hope of
\glspl{GW} existence~\chris{the existence of GWs} and helped lead the way
to~\chris{didn't really lead the way - more motivated} designing instruments
which could directly detect them.~\chris{up until about here you are simply
writing a series of static statements which sound stilted and read as bullet
points. This is the opening paragraph of the thesis so try to make this sound
smoother.} ~\chris{new paragrpah?} The first direct detection of gravitational
waves was made in 2015 when the two \gls{LIGO} detectors in the US
\citep{abbott2016ObservationGravitational} identified a signal from a \gls{BBH}
system.  This was not only the first observation of a \gls{GW} but gave
information on a yet~\chris{an as yet} unobserved~\chris{type of} astrophysical
system.  This has since been followed by many more detections of \gls{BBH}
signals involving \gls{LIGO} and Virgo including
\citep{abbott2017GW170814ThreeDetector,theligoscientificcollaboration2020GW190425Observation}~\chris{strange
way to refer to citations}.  In 2017 the \gls{LIGO} detectors observed the
first \gls{BNS} system \citep{abbott2017GW170817Observation} which had a
corresponding electromagnetic counterpart~\chris{ambiguous, first system
detected but that also had an EM counterpart OR first system with a counterpart
detected?}.  This allowed verification~\chris{what does verification eman in
this sense?} of the source from optical counterparts and started the era of
multi-messenger astronomy.  These detections opened up the field of
gravitational wave~\chris{if you have an acronym then use it, don't pick and
choose} astronomy, where many more detections are expected to give more
information on the universe and objects within it.

As well as searching for \gls{BBH} and \gls{BNS} signals, there are many
efforts to detect other types of \gls{GW} signals.  This thesis focuses on
efforts to search for a particular type of \gls{GW} which are thought to
originate from rapidly rotating neutron stars.  In chapters \ref{intro} and
\ref{searchcw} I will review introductory material.  This includes a general
introduction to the generation of \glspl{GW} in Sec.~\ref{intro:gravwaves} and
their sources in Sec.~\ref{intro:sources}.  I will then introduce instruments
used to detect \gls{GW} in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector}.  In Chapter
\ref{searchcw} I will introduce the general model for \glspl{CW} and current
methods used to detect them.  Chapters \ref{soap}, \ref{machine} and
\ref{detchar} will go into detail about techniques developed by the author to
search for \gls{CW} signals.  Finally I will summarise this work and discuss
future developments in chapter \ref{summary}
~\chris{This is a very short introduction to the thesis. This is your
opportunity to lay the ground work (in a non-technical way) before you get into
the details. You could really expand upon the ideas mentioned here. What else
can you say about GWs? What else can you say about the Hulse-Taylor Pulsar
(they won a Nobel Prize), what else can you say about 150914 and 170817? Prove
to the examiner that you are an expert in the general field of GW astrophysics.}

\section{\label{intro:gravwaves}Gravitational waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

In general relativity, gravity is thought of as the curvature of space-time and
matter moves according to this curvature.  The matter in the universe also has
an effect on the curvature of the space-time.  The larger the mass of matter
the more the space-time is distorted~\chris{more short sharp stochastic
statements}.  Space-time can generally be described by Einstein's field
equations~\chris{ref to Einstein 1915?}
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwaves:efe}
    G_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu \nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the
stress-energy tensor.  The stress energy tensor describes the mass-energy in
the universe~\chris{not really the universe in general. It describes the stress
energy of the system under consideration}, where its components contain
information on the density of energy and momentum~\chris{of what?}.  The
Einstein tensor contains information on the curvature of the
universe.~\chris{why not replace the full stop and "This" with "which"?
smoother} This can be derived directly from the metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$
which describes the geometry of the universe~\chris{again with the universe}.
Einstein's equations then explain how the curvature of space-time changes with
the mass-energy within it.  In empty space one can assume that the geometry of
space-time is flat, i.e. there is no curvature to space-time. The metric tensor
for this can then be defined as
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{matrix}
\right).
\end{equation}
Each index of this matrix refers to a space-time dimension, i.e. $x^0 = t$,
$x^1=x$, $x^2=y$ and $x^3=z$.  Measuring a distance $dx$ in space-time can be
different for different observers, therefore, one needs a measure which is
invariant for every observer.  This is the space-time interval $ds$, also known
as the line element, between two `events' in space-time.  This is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:lineelement}
    ds^2 = g_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}.
\end{equation}

As in Einstein's notation this is a sum over the indices $\mu$ and
$\nu$~\chris{strange phrasing}.  Equation \ref{intro:lineelement} can be
thought to describe the space-time `distance' between the two events.  For flat
space-time, $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, this can then be written as
%
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.
\end{equation}
%
The Einstein equations~\chris{defined in or by} Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwaves:efe}
then demonstrate how the curvature of space-time $G_{\mu\nu}$ depends on the
matter and energy distribution $T_{\mu \nu}$ within it.~\chris{I think that
there are enough steps missing between defining G from g that this last
statement doesn't really explain how the interval gets us from Minkowski to
space-time curvature.}

A gravitational wave can be described as a ripple in this space time~\chris{you
already said this, maybe expand upon "ripple" here}.  The simplest way to
visualise this is just a small time dependent change to the flat space-time
metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$.  In~\chris{the} linearised theory of gravity, the
space-time metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwave:metric}
    g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu},
\end{equation}
where $ \eta_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric for flat space-time and $h_{\mu \nu}$ is
some perturbation, where $|h_{\mu \nu}| \ll 1$
\citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}.  In this linearised theory the
perturbations to the metric tensor are assumed to be small~\chris{well yes, you
just said that in the previous sentence?}, therefore, Einstein's field
equations can be solved such that the solution is a plane wave~\chris{this
sentence reads as though, because the perturbations are small, logically that
means there is a plane wave solution. I would advise rephrasing it. In the
regime of small perturbations it can be shown that the solutions are... }.
More information on this derivation can be found in
\citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational,letiec2016TheoryGravitational}.  By
using $g_{\mu \nu}$ from Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwave:metric}, we can write the
linearised Einstein equations as
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:lineinstein}
    \Box h_{\mu \nu} = -16 \pi T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\Box$ is the d'Alembert operator which in flat space~\chris{but we are
in perturbed space, not flat space - explain} is defined by
\begin{equation}
		\Box = -\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
\end{equation}
In empty space there is no matter, therefore, all the components of the stress
energy tensor are zero, i.e. $T_{\mu \nu} = 0$.  This allows
Eq.~\ref{intro:lineinstein} to be reduced to
\begin{equation}
    \Box h_{\mu \nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
which is of course the wave equation.  This follows the same form as in
electrodynamics and the general plane-wave solutions have the form
\begin{equation}
    h_{\mu\nu} = A_{\mu\nu}e^{ik_{\alpha} x^{\alpha}},
\end{equation}
where each component of $h_{\mu \nu}$ is a sinusoid traveling along vector
$k_{\alpha}$~\chris{I think they are travelling along vector $k$ and
$k_{\alpha}$ are the components of the vector} with amplitude $A_{\mu\nu}$
\citep{capano2011SearchingGravitational}.  At this point the set of equations
are not simple; the symmetric tensor $A_{\mu \nu}$ has 10 independent
components~\chris{why is it symmetric? It is, but why?}. This can be greatly
simplified by choosing a different gauge where the metric perturbation is both
transverse and traceless (TT) \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}.  This is
just a choice of coordinate system which does not change any current
assumptions \joe{read more about gauges}~\chris{See Martin Hendry's GR notes
section of GWs}. A traceless metric is one where the sum of the diagonal
elements are 0 and a transverse metric is when the oscillations are
perpendicular to the direction of travel.~\chris{this previous sentence can be
removed since you then repeat it next}  This gauge imposes two conditions: one
is that $h_{\mu \nu}$ is traceless, i.e. that the sum of the diagonal elements
are 0 and the other is that $h_{\mu \nu}$ is transverse.  The transverse
element means that the oscillations of the wave happen perpendicular to the
direction of travel.  At this point we can choose that the wave is traveling in
the $z$ direction which means that $k = (\omega,0,0,k)$.  By then adopting the
TT gauge there are only two unique components to the metric such that the
perturbation is
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gw:gravwave}
h_{\mu \nu} = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{matrix}
\right) 
e^{i(kt - wt)}.
\end{equation}
The two unique components are then the two polarisations of gravitational
waves, $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$.  The affect~\chris{careful with your affects
and effects. This one is wrong.} of each of the polarisations on a
ring of test particles~\chris{say more! This is your best opportunity to
express what GWs actually do. What are test particles? What does the diagram
actually show?} can be seen in Fig.~\ref{gw:polarisations} where the
gravitational wave is travelling out of the page.~\chris{think about having
paragraphs even when you;re going through the maths. There is currently 1
single paragraph in section 1.1}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/polarisation_ring.pdf}
 \caption[Plus and Cross polarisations]{Shows~\chris{what shows? Don't trim
down sentences like this - Diagrams showing ...} how the plus and cross
polarisations affect a ring of test particles. This assumes
the~\chris{gravitational?} wave is travelling out of the page and the effects
have been greatly exaggerated. This also shows an example of how this
effects~\chris{affects} the test masses of an interferometer.  This will be
described in more detail in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector}~\chris{yes, but more
description - if not here then definitely in the text}.}
\label{gw:polarisations}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Generating gravitational waves}

To generate gravitational waves~\chris{I won't mention it again but use your
acronyms or remove your acronyms} we go back to Eq.~\ref{intro:lineinstein}
where we include the stress-energy term on the right hand side.~\chris{but we
haven't returned to the RHS yet - at least that is not clear at this point}
Following the derivation in \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}, one can
find that the gravitational wave amplitude~\chris{what is the GW amplitude? How
is it related to $h_{\mu\nu}$?} is related to the second moment of the mass
distribution.  The second moment of the mass distribution~\chris{clunky double
use of 2nd moment of the ...} $I_{\mu\nu}$is defined as
\begin{equation}
    I_{\mu \nu}(t) = \int \rho(t,{\bf x}) x^\mu x^\nu d^3x,
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the mass density, and $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the
coordinates~\chris{the coordinates ahve already been
defined}~\citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}.  This is the quadrupole
moment tensor without the trace subtracted~\chris{great! but why is that
relavent?}. The gravitational wave amplitude is then
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:gravwave:amp}
    h_{\mu \nu} = \frac{2}{r}  \frac{d^2 I_{\mu \nu}(t-r)}{dt^2},
\end{equation}
~\chris{please make the fraction look more like a second derivative and not
just a fraction, i.e. put the $I$ term after the fraction} where $r$ is the
distance from the source \citep{letiec2016TheoryGravitational}.  This has a
slight modification in the TT gauge, see
\citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}, however, has the same relationship
between the mass quadrupole and the \gls{GW} amplitude.  This shows that for
\gls{GW} to be generated, the second derivative of the mass quadrupole moment
is needed.  A mass quadrupole moment only exists when the mass distribution is
not spherically symmetric.  Therefore, a mass which is asymmetric and
accelerating will produce a \gls{GW}.~\chris{OK, a couple of things. You've
simplified the TT guage aspect which is OK if you do it sensibly. Things like,
why not the dipole moment? might come up. You could address that here. A
non-sherically symmetric mass distribution doesn't have to emit GWs, it also
has to be moving in such a way that 2nd moment is not zero. The accelerating
statement is a bit misleading. Finally, you also get GWs at higher orders than
quadrupole.}

Systems which will produce detectable~\chris{what does detectible mean?}
\glspl{GW} are generally rapidly rotating high~\chris{try not use words like
this unless they're qualified. What is high? } mass systems which have some
asymmetry around their rotation axis.  The sources of these \gls{GW} will be
described in the following section.~\chris{just be careful. Things don't have
to be rotating to emit GWs.  What about supernovae, or the big-bang, or a
head-on collision between 2 objects. All you need is a non-zero quyadrupole
momement (or higher order).}

\section{\label{intro:sources}Sources and signals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are many potential sources for \gls{GW}.~\chris{why such a short
sentence? Join it onto the next one.} The expected sources can be split into 3
general categories based on their signal type: Transient, Stochastic and
\glspl{CW}.  These categories are chosen based on the length of the signal and
how well modelled the signal is.  Figure \ref{intro:sources:signaltypes} shows
an example of each of the signals and their category.~\chris{I'm a bit
confused. We've got 3 categories (transient, stochastic and CWs) but we also
have 2 types (short and long) but we also have 2 orthogonal types (modelled and
un-modelled). Just to add to this, the LVC has always had 4 groups (CW, CBC,
burst, stochastic). I like your diagram but I don't like the statrement that
their are 3 categories.}
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/sources_types.pdf}
    \caption[GW signal types]{Each \gls{GW} signal type can be categorised
based on its signal length and how well the signal is modelled. Transient
signals which are short duration in the ground based detector band, include
both well modelled \gls{CBC} signals and unknown Burst signals. Long duration
signals include well modelled \gls{CW} signals and unknown Stochastic
signals.~\chris{What is being plotted on each axis? I know it's just a sketch
but you need to indicate that these ar timeseries of strain amplitudes. Also,
there is a distinction between un-modelled and unknown signals, e.g., the
stochastic background may well be well-modelled but since it's just noise,
knowing the noise parameters doesn't tell us the noise realisation. You are
also not making any statements about potential amplitudes here (long duration
typically being weaker amplitude)}}
\label{intro:sources:signaltypes}
\end{figure}

In the sections that follow, I will give an overview of the potential sources
of each of these signal categories and their wave-forms~\chris{decide on
waveform or wave-form. Be consistent.}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{sources:transient}Transient}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Transient sources of \glspl{GW} are short duration signals which are, depending
on the source, observable from milliseconds to tens of seconds in current
ground based detectors frequency band.  Some of these sources, particularly
\gls{CBC} sources, will emit signals for a much longer time, however these are
at a lower frequency and not observable by current ground based detectors
detectors~\chris{The BNS detection 170817 was in our detcetors band for ~100
seconds so you should correct you statements here.}. Transient signals can be
further split into two categories based on how well they are modelled.
\glspl{CBC} have well modelled wave-forms and bursts are generally from
un-modelled or unknown sources.

\subsubsection{\label{sources:transient:cbc}Compact Binary Coalescence}

\glspl{CBC} originate from the in-spiral and merger~\chris{and ring-down} of
two compact objects which are gravitationally bound.  The objects inspiral as
they lost~\chris{grammar} energy to~\chris{through?} the radiation of
gravitational waves.  Dependent on the masses and distances of the two objects,
the gravitational waves generated by the system can be detected by ground based
detector such as \gls{LIGO} \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO} and Virgo
\citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo}.  In fact, the only detections to date have
been of this type; these are summarised in
\citep{ligoscientificcollaborationandvirgocollaboration2019GWTC1GravitationalWave}~\chris{these
are opportunities to write your interpretation of the detections}.

The compact objects referred to here are either either black holes or neutron
stars.  There are generally three types of \gls{CBC} source: \gls{BBH},
\gls{BNS} and \gls{NSBH}.  The general structure of the waveform is the same
for each of these and follows a `chirp' where the \gls{GW} frequency increases
with time until merger~\chris{what about ring-down?}. An example of this is shown in
Fig.~\ref{intro:sources:signaltypes}.  The maximum frequency of this inspiral
is defined by the mass of the system.  This can be estimated by assuming that a
source cannot be much smaller than the Schwarzchild radius~\chris{vague
language. why do you say this?} and given the light
travel time of this~\chris{light travel time of what?} \citep{g2000NeutrinosPhysics}~\chris{why are you
referencing a neutrino paper?}, one can estimate the maximum
frequency as~\chris{please clarify this argument}
\begin{equation}
    f \lesssim \frac{1}{4 \pi G M/ c^3}  \sim 10^{4} \mathrm{Hz} \frac{M_{\odot}}{M} .
\end{equation}
~\chris{new paragpraph?}\gls{LIGO} is sensitive from $\sim 10$ Hz to $\sim
10^4$ Hz, therefore can see masses up to $\mathcal{O}(100)\, M_{\odot}$, where
the lower mass limit for compact objects is $\sim 1.4\, M_{\odot}$~\chris{do
you mean total mass here?  We do search down to 1 solar mass per component and
obviously we do search for BNS systems at around 1.4 each. Your equation 1.13
is a rough approximation so don't be too specific - the lower limit is O(1)
solar mass total mass}. Current detections of \glspl{BBH} are in the mass
ranges from $\sim 7M_{\odot}$ to $\sim 50M_{\odot}$
\citep{ligoscientificcollaborationandvirgocollaboration2019GWTC1GravitationalWave}~\chris{be
careful with what you are saying. Is this total mass or component mass? Be
specific}, where the signals are detectable by ground based detectors for $<
1\,s$.  Lower mass systems ($1-2\,M_{\odot}$) from \glspl{BNS} merge at
lower~\chris{higher} frequencies and therefore~\chris{the therefore statement
doesn't really follow. They merge at higher frequencies becuase they are
compact enough to keep inspiralling without touching. They takle longer to get
there because they are smaller and are losing GW energy at a lower rate so they
spend longer sweeping through the band.}, can be detected in \gls{LIGO} for
longer periods $\mathcal{O}(10)$s~\chris{as mentioned before, 170817 was in the
band for ~100 sec}.  The lower frequency parts of the signal (i.e. earlier
times) aim to be detected by future space based detectors such as \gls{LISA}
\citep{danzmann1996LISALaser}~\chris{the signal itself deosn't "aim" to do
anything. WE aim to detect the GWS from these systems at earlier stages of
their evolution using space based detectors operating at lower frequency.
However, it is unlikely that BNS systems will be visible in LISA-like detectors
since they are relatively weak sources. BBH signals will be seen in LISA. Look
at https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06951}.

In systems which have a neutron star, during the in-spiral~\chris{inspiral or
in-spiral - you decide.} and merger phase~\chris{what about the ring-down?},
the neutron star can deform due to tidal interactions between the objects
\citep{flanagan2008ConstrainingNeutronstar}.  This becomes useful as it will
affect the generated waveform and can help~\chris{us?} place limits on and determine the
\gls{EOS} for the dense matter in a neutron star
\citep{harry2018ObservingMeasuring}.~\chris{yes, OK. We can do EOS measurements
with BNS systems, but we can also use them as standard sirens (BBHs too) to do
cosmology. We can also analyse the mass and spin distributions to determine the
formation mechanisms. With BBH systems we can do tests of GR in the strong
field regime. There is a long list of things we can do with CBC detections. My
point is why do you only mention one of them?}
%\citep{hernandezvivanco2019MeasuringNeutron} \gls{BNS} systems also offer a
%way do observe objects in multiple different channels, or what is known as
%multi-messenger astronomy.  This is where the object can be viewed in the
%\gls{EM} spectrum as well as in gravitational waves.  This offers much in the
%field of astronomy as it can aid in the measurement of the Hubble constant
%\citep{theligoscientificcollaborationandthevirgocollaboration2017GravitationalwaveStandard}.
%Observations of \gls{BBH} systems can also give information on how black holes
%and \glspl{BBH} form, more details on this can be found in
%\citep{zevin2017ConstrainingFormation,mandel2018MergingStellarmass}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{sources:transient:burst}Burst}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Burst sources are also short duration however, ~\chris{they?} are un-modelled or
difficult to model, in the sense that the exact waveform of the signal is
unknown.  There are two possible reasons for the lack in knowledge of the
waveform: the physics of the system is too complicated to model in a reasonable
amount of time~\chris{what does a reasonbale amount of time mean? For
supernovae the simulations are computaionally costly but the problem is
modelling all of the physics.} or there is no model of the source.  As there is
no model to generate waveforms, burst searches cannot use matched filtering as
in \gls{CBC} searches~\chris{do CBC searches use matched filtering? You haven't
mentioned that yet. What is matched filtering?}. Rather, burst searches look
for short bursts in power~\chris{what is power?}
which is coincident between multiple detectors
\citep{cornish2015BayeswaveBayesian, klimenko2008CoherentMethod}.  There are a
number of systems which could potentially emit  short duration burst signals.
These include core collapse supernovae \citep{ott2008GravitationalWave},
\glspl{GRB} \citep{aasi2014SearchGravitational}~\chris{aren't GRBs the signal
you get from a BNS merger, not an un-modelled burst? Are you taling about a
different type of GRB?}, cosmic strings
\citep{damour2005GravitationalRadiation} and other unknown sources.  Detecting
\gls{GW} from one of these sources could offer more insight into the processes
which cause core collapse supernovae~\chris{careful with your explanations.
Only a detection of a core collapse supernova could tell us about that, not any
of the other things you listed.}. 

As burst searches are un-modelled, they are sensitive to almost any signal
which is coherent between detectors~\chris{what does "coherent" between
detectors mean?}. This allows them to also search for signals from \gls{CBC} as
well as any \gls{GW} signal from an unknown source.~\chris{strange phrasing}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Stochastic}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The stochastic background has no signal model~\chris{yes it does. Different
models predict differnt background spectra - just like we estimate/predict the
PSD of the detector noise. Theorists predict the PSD of the stochastic
background and it may depend on a number of unknown parameters. The key point
is that the noise realisation can't be predicted}, however, is expected to be a
persistent source of \gls{GW} in the background of the detector.  The
stochastic background~\chris{this is the astrophysical background - this is
disinct from the primordial stochastic backgroiund from the big-bang.} is the
incoherent sum of many unresolved~\chris{what is "unresolved"?} \gls{GW}
signals.  The source of these signals can be anything from cosmological sources
such as cosmic strings to \gls{CBC} signals~\chris{these signals are the
cumulative sum of the ensemble of all "unresolved" sources in the universe.}.
These signals can be thought of as the \gls{GW} analogue of the
\gls{CMB}~\chris{well kind of. The astrophysical background is more like the
foreground noise that the CMB scientists have to remove. The real CMB analogy
is the primordial GW stochastic background from the big-bang.}.  The signal is
assumed to be isotropic such that it can be observed at any point on the sky
\citep{christensen2018StochasticGravitational}~\chris{a strange interpretation
of isotropic. Isotropic means that the statistical properties of the background
are the same in any direction we observe it. Thst's definitley the case for the
primordial background but for the astrophsyical background, local structure in
universe may mean it won't be isotropic. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2762}.
As the stochastic background is noise-like it is very difficult to distinguish
from noise within a single detector
\citep{christensen2018StochasticGravitational}.  Therefore, searches for the
stochastic background correlate signals between multiple detectors
\citep{romano2019SearchesStochastic,christensen2018StochasticGravitational}.
When detected, these signals may be able to offer insights into the early
universe and its formation~\chris{please expand upon this in light of my
comments}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\label{intro:sources:cw}Continuous waves}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\glspl{CW} are long duration signals which can be well modelled~\chris{don't
you do a search for un-modelled CWs? How does that fit in with this
definition?}.  The signals last for times~\chris{have durations?} greater than
the observation runs of ground based detectors and in general have a
fixed~\chris{I don't know of any case with a fixed frequency especially if
you're talking about received signals} or slowly varying frequency.  There are
a number of potential sources of \glspl{CW} including a \gls{CBC} signal
earlier in the inspiral phase.  Before the final stages of the inspiral of a
\gls{CBC} signal, the objects orbiting at much slower non-relativistic
speeds.~\chris{these last 2 sentences need to be cleaned up/merged to make more
sense. The second sentence isn't really a sentence} They therefore emit a
\gls{GW} with a slowly varying frequency and can remain in this phase for
millions of years~\chris{too basic and vague. Are you sure it's not hundreds of
thousands? Do a calculation }.  This signal however, is at lower frequency than
ground based detectors can detect, therefore space based detectors such as
\gls{LISA} \citep{danzmann1996LISALaser} are expected to observe this type of
\gls{CW}.~\chris{OK, yes, but why start the sectiuon talking about a source
that isn't that important. Wouldn't it be better to discuss LISA CW sources at
the end. Plus the main LISA CW soiurce is white dwarf binaries.}

The primary source for many \glspl{CW} searches is rapidly rotating neutron
stars with spin periods ranging from $\sim 10^{-3} - 10$ s
\citep{manchester2005AustraliaTelescope}.  Neutron stars originate when a
massive star $\sim 11 - 20 M_{\odot}$ collapses and are the remnant of this
collapse, they are objects with incredibly high density~\chris{you can't use
phrases like this "incredibly high"? What does that mean? Be more specific and
scientific} and are highly magnetised with field strengths of $10^8 - 10^{15}$
G \citep{konar2017MagneticFields}.  They have masses around $1.4-2 \;
M_{\odot}$ contained in a star with radius of $\sim 10$ km.  Despite many
observations in the electromagnetic spectrum and a large amount of research,
these objects are not well understood.  A key part or neutron stars which is
not understood is the \gls{EOS}. A review of the current understanding can be
found in \cite{lattimer2016EquationState}.  The \gls{EOS} relates quantities
such as the pressure and density of a neutron star and dictates how the neutron
star matter behaves.  Observations of \glspl{GW} from neutron stars can place
limits on the \gls{EOS} of this type of matter.  These observations have
already been made in the form of \gls{BNS} mergers
\citep{abbott2017GW170817Observation}.  However, independent observations of
rapidly rotating neutron stars can add to this understanding by placing limits
on the deformability of the star and therefore the \gls{EOS}.~\chris{OK, a bit
stocato at the start of the paragraph. You could think about linking up some
sentences and expanding on them. All quantitative statements should ave a
reference e.g., the mass statement. The language could be more scientific in
places, "a large amount of research" sounds a bit undergraduate. }

For a neutron star to emit a gravitational wave~\chris{be more specific, a CW
GW} it needs to have some asymmetry in its mass distribution around its
rotation axis,~\chris{not appropriate use of a comma} this follows from
Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwave:amp}.  There are a number of different mechanisms which
could cause this and emit \glspl{GW}, some of these are reviewed in
\citep{glampedakis2017GravitationalWaves,riles2017RecentSearches,haskell2015DetectingGravitational,lasky2015GravitationalWaves}.
Here I will summarise two main theories: Neutron star mountains and neutron
star oscillations.

%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{intro:source:cw:mountain}Mountains}
%%%%%%%%%

One of more likely mechanisms for detectable \gls{GW} emission from neutron
stars is from `mountains' on the surface of the star.  These are permanent
deformations of the crust which are non axisymmetric, i.e. the deformation is
not symmetric around the rotation axis.

This deformation or asymmetry can be quantified by the ellipticity $\epsilon$ of the neutron star.
This is defined using the principal moments of inertial

\begin{equation}
\label{ellipticity}
\epsilon = \frac{I_{xx}-I_{yy}}{I_{zz}},
\end{equation}

where $I_{zz},I_{xx},I_{yy}$ are the principal moment of inertia~\chris{but
they're more like the different components of the inertia in each of the 3
spatial axes. Also, didn't you already use $I$ to represent the second moment
of the mass distribution in Sec 1.1. Are they the same thing?}.
This is when the star is rotating around the $z$ axis so $I_{zz}$ is along the
rotation axis.~\chris{clunky language} 

There are a number of theories which describe the origin of this axisymmetry.
If the pulsar is in a binary system and accreting material from its companion
star, the material can be funneled towards the magnetic poles by the magnetic
field, thereby causing a hot spot \citep{haskell2015DetectingGravitational}.
This `hot spot' could cause a deformation on the surface of the star which is
not axisymmetric.  The magnetic stresses from strong magnetic fields within the
star, could potentially also cause non axisymmetric deformations to the star
\citep{}.  Finally the spin down of the pulsar itself could cause stresses in
the crust of the star until the point of breaking, its then after this break
which could leave a distortion in the crust \citep{becker2009NeutronStars}.
More details on the signal waveform of this type of \gls{GW} and methods to
search for it will be explained in Sec.~\ref{searchcw}.
 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \subsubsection{Neutron star oscillations}
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are a number of oscillation modes within a star such as f-modes, p-modes
and r-modes \citep{becker2009NeutronStars}.  These are similar to oscillations
in the earth which are measured in terrestrial seismology.  The difference
between these modes is the restoring force bringing the perturbed state back to
equilibrium.  For example, gravity is the restoring force for f-modes where the
oscillations happen in the crust of the star.  The more promising of these for
gravitational wave emission and detection is the r-mode
\citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves}.  These are oscillations in the neutron
superfluid part of the star, where the restoring force is the Coriolis effect
from the rotation of the star.  These modes can become unstable to \gls{GW}
emission in rapidly rotating neutron stars \citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves},
making them most likely for a detection.  For more details on this mechanism
see
\citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves,owen1998GravitationalWaves,jonesCFSInstability}.

Figure \ref{intro:source:cw:rmode} shows an highly exaggerated view of a neutron star with an oscillation mode travelling in each direction.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/rmode.pdf}
	\caption[Generating \glspl{GW} from r-modes in neutron stars.]{The r-modes can travel in either direction in the star. in the case when the r-mode is moving clockwise and the neutron star is moving anti-clockwise, if the neutron star is rotating fast enough it can cause unstable emission of \gls{GW}. This image was reconstructed from \citep{jonesCFSInstability}.}
	\label{intro:source:cw:rmode}
\end{figure}
If these modes are excited in a non-rotating star, then they will emit \gls{GW} where the \gls{GW}  carries away angular momentum \citep{jonesCFSInstability}. 
For the mode travelling in a clockwise direction, this angular momentum is positive and the mode travelling anti-clockwise the angular momentum is negative. 
Therefore, the \gls{GW} is taking away either positive or negative angular momentum (adding angular momentum) depending on the direction of rotation.
The emission of \gls{GW} damps the modes and the magnitude of the perturbation decreases making them extremely difficult to detect.
Now if the neutron star is rotating, this can lead to an effect called the \gls{CFS} instability  \citep{chandrasekhar1970SolutionsTwo,friedman1978SecularInstability}. 
As the rotation speed of the neutron star increases, there are two different effects on the modes travelling in opposite directions. 
For the mode travelling anti-clockwise with the stars rotation, the mode will appear to be travelling faster, therefore, will emit more \gls{GW} taking away more angular momentum. This means that this mode will be damped more rapidly.
The interesting affect is for the mode travelling clockwise, opposite to the neutron stars rotation. 
At a certain rotation rate, the mode will be `frozen' from the observers perspective and no \gls{GW} will be emitted.
As the rotation rate increases further, the mode will appear to travel anti-clockwise to an observer, i.e. the mode is dragged in the opposite direction by the stars rotation. 
Here it is key to remember that this mode had negative angular momentum as in the neutron stars frame it is still travelling clockwise.
As the mode rotates its emits positive angular momentum, which is then subtracted from the modes negative angular momentum.
The magnitude of the angular momentum then increases such that more \glspl{GW} are released.
This effect causes the amplitude of the oscillation to grow and therefore become unstable.
Therefore, a neutron star is unstable to \gls{GW} emission if it is rotating sufficiently fast \citep{lasky2015GravitationalWaves}.
For a more detailed view on how r-modes generate \gls{GW} see \citep{owen1998GravitationalWaves,jonesCFSInstability}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The indirect detection of gravitational waves from the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar system left little doubt that \gls{GW} existed. 
The real challenge was to design an instrument which could directly detect gravitational waves.
There were a number of different proposed methods for the design of the instrument, notably: resonant bar detectors, both ground based and space based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays and cosmic microwave background (CMB) detectors. 
The first resonant bar detector was designed and built by Joseph Weber \citep{weber1966ObservationThermal}. 
These are large cylinders of metal which should resonate as a gravitational wave passes by. 
There are a few different designs of this type of detector, including an omni-directional design \citep{dewaard2003MiniGRAILFirst}. 
Pulsar timing arrays aim to use the accurate arrival time of pulses from millisecond pulsars to measure \gls{GW} \citep{hobbs2017GravitationalWave}. As a \gls{GW} passes between the pulsar and the observer, the arrival time of the pulses should change by $\mathcal{O}(10)$ ns \citep{hobbs2017GravitationalWave}. 
Whilst a detection has not been made using pulsar timing arrays, these methods are still in use.
Cosmic microwave background detectors aimed to look for evidence of gravitational waves in the polarisations of the CMB \citep{ade2018ConstraintsPrimordial}.  
These use the a range of detectors to look at the CMB however, are yet to confirm a detection of a \gls{GW} signal.
The most commonly known design of a \gls{GW} detector is the ground based interferometer, these made the first detection of \gls{GW} in 2015 \citep{abbott2016ObservationGravitational}. 
These are the focus of this section as the analysis that will follow uses data from the \gls{LIGO} detectors in the USA \citep{abbott2009LIGOLaser,aasi2015AdvancedLIGO} and Virgo detector in Italy \citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo,acernese2008StatusVirgo}.

\subsection{Laser Interferometers}
%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

Laser interferometers use the interference of light to measure a length with high precision.
The majority of this section will focus on ground based interferometers such as \gls{LIGO} and Virgo \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO,acernese2015AdvancedVirgo}.
A simple design of an interferometer is shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:interferometer:simple}. 
A laser beam is fired at a beam splitter which splits the light equally down two perpendicular arms. 
Each of these beams is reflected from a mirror at the end of either arm.
The light then returns to the beam splitter where the two beams are combined and sent to a photo-detector.
At the output, there is an interference pattern between the two beams.
If the length of one of the arms is changed then the interference pattern will change as the phase of one beam changes with respect to the other.
The phase difference of the light can be related to the wavelength of the light, $\lambda_l$ and the length of the detectors arms $L$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{intro:detectors:phasechange}
\Delta \phi \sim \frac{\Delta L}{\lambda_l},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta  \phi$ is the phase change and $\Delta L$ is the difference in the arm lengths.
An interferometer can then measure small changes in the mirrors position.

    \caption[Basic layout of the \gls{LIGO} detectors.]{\gls{LIGO} uses interferometry to make a detection. This has many additional features, one of which is shown above. ETMY and ETMX refer to the end test masses, which are the mirrors at the end of the interferometer arms. The beam splitter splits the Laser beam equally to each arm, this them recombines the beams back to the detector.
    ITMY and ITMX refer to the internal test masses, these create a Fabry-Perot cavity in the interferometers arms which can build up laser power. }
    \label{detectors:interferometer}
\end{figure}
%
This can be used in gravitational wave detection as the mirrors at the end of each arm of the interferometer can be treated as `free' test masses.
Figure \ref{gw:polarisations} shows the effect of a \gls{GW} on free test masses.
One can see this by looking at the proper separation between two test masses. 
If we place two test masses along the $x$ axis with separation $L_c$ where a gravitational wave is travelling along the $z$ axis, the proper distance between them is given by
\begin{equation}
    L = \int_{0}^{L_c} \sqrt{g_{xx}} dx,
\end{equation}
where $g_{xx} = 1 + h_{+}(t)$ is the combination of Eq.~\ref{intro:gravwave:metric} and Eq.~\ref{intro:gw:gravwave}. 
As the metric perturbation is small is can be can be expanded to first order, i.e. $\sqrt{g_{xx}} = \sqrt{1 + h_{+}(t)} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2}h_{+}(t)$.
The proper distance is then
\begin{equation}
    \label{intro:detectors:properdist}
    \begin{split}
     L &\approx \int_{0}^{L_c} 1 + \frac{1}{2}h_{+}(t) dx \\
      &\approx L_c + L_c \frac{1}{2}h_{+}(t).
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
From Eq.~\ref{intro:detectors:properdist} on can see that in this configuration the plus polarisation of the gravitational wave causes the separation between the two test masses to oscillate \citep{flanagan2005BasicsGravitational}.
This oscillation can then be expressed as a fractional length change 
\begin{equation}
    \label{intro:detectors:fraclength}
    \frac{\delta L}{L} \approx \frac{1}{2} h_{+}.
\end{equation}
In the interferometer, this affect changes the lengths of the two arms, which therefore changes $\Delta L$ in Eq.~\ref{intro:detectors:phasechange}.
The change of the interference pattern with time is then related to the \gls{GW}.
In practice the position of the two mirrors are held in position such that the interference pattern does not change.
The \gls{GW} is then related to the readout of the mirrors control system.

If one looks at Eq.~\ref{intro:detectors:fraclength} then if the mirrors at the end of the arms (ETMX and ETMY) are are placed further from the beam splitter, i.e. $L$ is increased, then the length change of the arms due to the gravitational wave will be greater.  
This means that increasing the length of the detectors arms increases the sensitivity of the interferometer. 
A method to achieve a similar affect without physically increasing the arm length is to use a Fabry-Perot cavity \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO}, this is shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:interferometer:fabry}.
This is where a semi-transparent mirror is placed between the beam splitter and end mirror in each arm (ITMX and ITMY).
Light enters this cavity and reflects back and forth between the two mirrors (ITMX and ETMX) a number of times before returning to the beam splitter.
This increases the time the light spends in one arm and is equivalent to increasing the arm length.
Actual ground based \gls{GW} detectors such as \gls{LIGO} \citep{abbott2009LIGOLaser} and Virgo \citep{acernese2015AdvancedVirgo} are much more complicated than described above.
They use many techniques to increase the sensitivity some of which are outlined in \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO,abbott2009LIGOLaser}.
Many of these techniques are designed to reduce non-astrophysical affects on the detector, some of these effects and solutions are listed in Sec.~\ref{intro:detector:noise}.

\subsubsection{Detector response}
%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%

An important factor to know when using detector data to search for astrophysical signals is the detectors antenna pattern.
This measures how sensitive the detector is to different directions.
An example of the antenna response for \gls{LIGO} is in Fig.~\ref{intro:detectors:response} where the detectors arms lie on the x and y axis of the image.
This is clear when thinking about how a gravitational wave affects the test masses as in Fig.~\ref{gw:polarisations}. 
As the \gls{GW} is transverse to its propagation, when the detector is face on to the source, there will be a maximum change in the arm lengths and therefore a maximum sensitivity. 
In the same way the sensitivity will be at a minimum when edge to the source.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{C1_intro/LIGO_beam_patterns.png}
    \caption[Antenna response of the \gls{LIGO} detectors.]{The antenna response is shown as in \citep{romano2019SearchesStochastic} for both the plus and cross polarisations and their average. The detectors arms lie on the x and y axis in the above plots. }
    \label{intro:detectors:response}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\label{intro:detector:noise}Noise sources}
%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%

To increase the sensitivity of the \gls{LIGO} detectors, any effect on the output of the interferometer which is not astrophysical ideally needs to be reduced.
This involves understanding what causes certain noise features in the detector, and how the affect of these can be limited. 
Within the detector, there are many sources of noise.
Some of these noise sources and how they limit the detectors strain sensitivity are all shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity} from \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{C1_intro/noise_sensitivity.jpg}
    \caption[Example strain sensitivity curves for different noise sources in \gls{LIGO}.]{The different noise sources affect the sensitivity of the \gls{LIGO} detectors at different frequencies. This shows the various sources how the affect the noise curve \citep{aasi2015AdvancedLIGO}.}
    \label{detectors:noisesensitivity}
\end{figure}
Here I will summarise some of the limiting sources and also sources which become useful for understanding later sections.

\begin{description}
\item[Seismic noise] This originates from vibrations in the earth which can be from effects such as the earths seismic activity or anthropogenic sources. This affects lower lower frequencies of \glspl{LIGO} spectrum. This can be oscillations such as earthquakes or ocean waves. Seismic waves cause the mirrors to oscillate and induce a change in the length of the arm. This is reduced by having multi stage suspensions in the detectors which filter out the seismic oscillations \citep{matichard2015SeismicIsolation}.

\item[Coating noise] This is in general due to two main factors, the thermal noise of the coating and Brownian noise. The Brownian noise is from the mechanical dissipation in the coating and the thermal noise is due to thermal dissipation. The Brownian noise is the dominant factor as shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity}. These effects are limited by using different coatings on the mirrors \citep{abernathy0OverviewResearch}.

\item[Quantum noise] Quantum noise is a fundamental limit due to the statistical uncertainty of counting photons. This limits the sensitivity at many frequencies.There are methods to reduce this include squeezing of the light \citep{aasi2013EnhancedSensitivity}. 

\item[Electronics noise \joe{technical noise maybe}] Whilst this is not shown in Fig.~\ref{detectors:noisesensitivity}, this becomes important to searches described later. These have a different effect on the detector which is more narrowband frequency lines. This is generated by the digital and analogue electronics that are used to measure the signal. 
\end{description}

There are also many other sources of noise in the detector which I have not listed. However, these are often not the limiting cases of noise or are not relevant to this thesis.
In Sec.~\ref{detchar} I will go into more detail about specific noise sources in the detector known as instrumental lines and how they can be monitored and potentially removed.
