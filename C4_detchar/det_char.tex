\chapter{Detector Characterisation}


\begin{itemize}
    \item understanding how the detector affects the data is important when searching for a signal
    \item many ways which detector is affected, some noise sources mention in Seec into detectors
    \item the most contaminating for CW searches is instrumental lines which we will mention in sec ...

\section{Instrumental lines}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
    \item instumentla lines are long or short duration detector artifacts
    \item can be narrow and short or broad and long duration
    \item many examples from known sources
    \item many searches currently exist which look through data
    \item . wandering lines are a large problem as hard to track especially when weak
    \item SOAP can identify weak lines when they are wandering or fixed frequency
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item overview of soap search and what type is used for line searches
    \item how this is applied and how to interpret the output for lines searches

\begin{itemize}
    \item why summary pages are useful 
    \item how to read them and what they mean
    \item how to use the information with other searches
